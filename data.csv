In healthy people, the immune system is able to distinguish between the self and nonself, a concept called self-tolerance. When the body is functioning properly, the immune system maintains self-tolerance while working in the background to protect the body from infections.In people with autoimmune disease, self-tolerance does not function correctly, causing the body to turn the powerful weapons of the immune system against self molecules, causinginflammationand injury. Autoimmune disease can be systemic, affecting multiple parts of the body, such as in diseases likesystemic lupus erythematosus(SLE). They can also be organ-specific, such as intype 1 diabetes, where the immune system targets and destroys theinsulin-producing cells of the pancreas."

However, more human trials are still needed to provide a better understanding of when, and in whom, these interventions are effective. It is also important to keep in mind that the efficacy and safety of diet interventions will likely vary from person to person, with some potentially being harmful for certain people.Metabolic status in the body is intimately connected to immune function. For example, undernourished people tend to be more susceptible to infections, while the nutrient excess associated with the Western diet may be associated with increased risk of autoimmunity.[1]This suggests that in the future, appropriate diet interventions could potentially help to reduce disease activity in people with active disease, or even lessen disease risk in those who are susceptible."

Doctors will also review the patient’s family medical history to determine whether anybody has been diagnosed with celiac disease. Genetic testing is also often performed to look for gene variants linked to increased disease risk. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of celiac disease is through the detection of specific antibodies in the blood and confirmation of damage tovilli(tiny nutrient-absorbing structures) in the small intestine through a biopsy.[5]It is important to note that a positive diagnosis is only possible after gluten exposure for several weeks before the test. People on gluten-free diets may be advised by their physician to start a “gluten challenge,” which involves several weeks of continuous gluten exposure, since elimination of gluten from the diet can lead to a false-negative diagnosis.[6]"

This rules out any foods that contain wheat, barley, rye, triticale (a cross between wheat and rye), kamut, or farro; this includes semolina, couscous, most cereals, pasta, beers, breads, crackers, wraps, and baked goods. People with celiac disease also need to be careful to avoid hidden exposure to gluten, which can occur with processed foods. For example, processed foods based on corn or rice (neither of which contain gluten) could contain trace amounts of contaminating gluten if they were produced in factories that also make wheat products."

Consuming gluten triggers destruction ofvilli, tiny finger-like projections lining the small intestine that absorb nutrients from food. People who are genetically susceptible have particular variants of the genes encodingmajor histocompatibility complex(MHC) class II molecules, which play a role in the sensing of foreign proteins by the immune system. The MHC class II genes HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 bind to gluten-derived peptides, triggering the immune response that causes intestinal damage. Although HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 seem to be required to develop the disease, they are not sufficient, since only 1% of the population has celiac disease, in spite of 40% having HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8.[12]"

Fistulas, anal fissures, and ulcers can be treated with medication and dietary modifications, but in some cases, severely damaged sections of the intestine may need to be surgically removed and rerouted or attached to a reservoir to enable the passage of stool.Severe symptoms may also require bowel rest, which can involve partial enteral nutrition — using specific liquid formulas to meet a patient’s dietary needs — or delivering nutrients intravenously to bypass the GI tract completely. Partial enteral nutrition may help to prevent flares when a patient is in remission, especially when fed through a nasogastric tube that delivers the formula directly into the stomach through the nose.[4][5]"

Blood tests will be performed to analyze levels of thyroid hormones and check for the presence of particular autoantibodies. Diagnosis can be confirmed through radioactive iodine uptake testing. The thyroid gland absorbsiodineto make thyroid hormones, and in people with Graves’ disease, overproduction of thyroid hormones increases iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, which can be measured with a thyroid scan. Doctors will also use the thyroid scan to analyze the pattern of iodine uptake, which can help to distinguish Graves’ disease from other thyroid disorders.[7]"

However, there are treatment options for hyperthyroidism, including surgery, medications, and radioiodine therapy. Radioiodine therapy involves ingestion of a radioactive form of iodine, which destroys the cells in the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormones. Medications such as beta blockers can reduce some of the symptoms of Graves’ disease, such as rapid heartbeat, tremors, and nervousness. Antithyroid medications that work by reducing the production of thyroid hormones are also commonly prescribed. Surgery is another common treatment for hyperthyroidism and involves removing part or most of the thyroid gland.[7]"

However, therapy often results inhypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland),[7]which could potentially require dietary changes to mitigate weight gain in certain individuals. Hyperthyroidism can also potentially mask a predisposition for weight gain or obesity, which may require diet changes to avoid excessive weight after the hyperthyroidism is treated.[17]"

Commonly used antithyroid therapies are associated with an increased risk that disease symptoms will return after treatment is stopped. The downside to ablative therapies such as radioiodine therapy or surgery is that many people will eventually develop hypothyroidism, which will require lifelong hormone therapy. Immunotherapies designed to treat the underlying autoimmune process that causes Graves’ disease are under development and are being designed with the goal of restoring immune tolerance to some of the self-proteins targeted by autoimmunity. If these immunotherapies are successful, stopping the underlying autoimmune process could potentially restore thyroid hormones back to normal, healthy levels without inducing hypothyroidism. Some of these therapies are being tested in early-phase clinical trials, with promising results.[18]"

It plays a vital role in regulating numerous body functions, including heart rate, body temperature, metabolism, and growth and development, through the production of thyroid hormones that communicate with various cells and tissues in the body.Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause ofhypothyroidism(underactive thyroid) in the U.S. and in other regions of the world with sufficientiodineintake (which is necessary for the thyroid gland to function properly). In people with Hashimoto’s disease, the immune system inappropriately targets the thyroid gland, leading to tissue damage, inflammation and scarring that ultimately decreases thyroid hormone production. The disease often appears in people who are 30-50 years old and is at least 10 times more common in women than men.[1]Hashimoto’s disease is strongly associated with other autoimmune diseases, so your physician may search for other disorders associated with autoimmunity."

BCCs usually occur on the face (e.g., nose, ears, and lip) and neck as well as other areas with past exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., sunlight). Bleeding and scabbing is a common sign of BCC.Squamous cell carcinomas:SCCs are typically pink to red-colored bumps. The affected skin can be scaly and appear inflamed. As with BCCs, SCCs most commonly occur on the face, neck, and other areas with past exposure to ionizing radiation. SCCs are often preceded by red, scaly areas of skin known as actinic keratoses.Melanoma:Melanomas are usually brown to black-colored lesions, resembling a mole, though they can also be pink papules. These lesions are generally asymmetrical, with irregularly-shaped, poorly-defined borders. Melanomas also tend to grow over time, often becoming larger than 6 mm in diameter (roughly the size of a pencil eraser).

Red yeast rice sometimes contains monacolin K, which is identical to the statin lovastatin. For this reason, red yeast rice products containing non-negligible amounts of monacolin K are banned by the FDA since they are a “non-approved drug”.[24][25]If monacolin K is present, red yeast rice may have similar effects and safety profiles to statins.[26][27]However, the methodology for assessing safety in trials is often poor.[27]Additionally,garlicsupplements decrease total cholesterol and LDL-C, though not consistently, with unclear impacts on HDL-C.[28][29]Effects on LDL-C and HDL-C may occur less often when garlic supplements are given alongside a lipid-lowering diet.[30][31][32].Finally,psylliumfiber can have beneficial effects not only on LDL-C, but on non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels, which may be more predictive of cardiovascular disease than LDL-C.[3]"

After HF is diagnosed, it is then further classified based on severity and type. The two main types, which often have different causes, are:HF with reduced ejection fraction(HFrEF), in which the heart can’t squeeze with enough force to push out all the blood, andHF with preserved ejection fraction(HFpEF), in which the heart can’t fully relax to be filled with enough blood to supply the body.[2][1]"

These hormones, alongside other metabolic changes, make the pregnant parent’s body less responsive toinsulin, the hormone that allows glucose to leave the bloodstream and enter the body’s cells.[28]This is calledinsulin resistance. Normally, the pancreas secretes more insulin to combat this resistance and keep blood glucose under control.

Serumferritintesting is recommended in patients with anemia to diagnose iron deficiency, as it has good accuracy compared to the (invasive) gold standard for diagnosis of bone marrow biopsy. It is the best biochemical test to indicate iron stores, and a ferritin level below 30 micrograms per liter of blood (µg/L) can indicate iron deficiency in anemia.Serum ferritin is also an acute phase reactant — in other words, a marker of inflammation — therefore,C-reactive proteinshould also be measured to rule out a false elevation of ferritin from an inflammatory condition or infection. Depending on the condition, a cutoff value of less than 100 µg/L may be used for ferritin.[4][5][2]Iron deficiency anemia may also show the following signs on bloodwork:Mean corpuscular volume(MCV), a measure of RBC size: less than 80 femtoliters (fL)Mean cell hemoglobin(MCH), a measure of RBC iron content: less than 25 g/dLPercentage transferrin saturation less than 16% (or <20% in the presence of inflammation)[6][5][2]In addition: serum transferrin may be high, serum iron may be low, and total iron-binding capacity may be high.[7][8]If iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, and the clinician suspects it may have a gastrointestinal cause, then tests such as a urea breath test (forH. pyloriinfection), serologic testing for celiac disease (tissue transglutaminase IgA), fecal occult blood testing (i.e., stool sample), upper endoscopy (i.e., viewing the esophagus, stomach, and upper intestines), or colonoscopy may also be performed to investigate for causes of blood loss.[4][7]"

Lower doses of iron may be equally effective while reducing adverse effects.[9][11][12]. Some studies suggest that alternate-day dosing may be superior to consecutive-day dosing for increasing iron absorption.[9]Common side effects of iron supplementation are constipation, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Other oral forms, such as ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, or iron suspensions, may be tolerated better, though there is inconsistent evidence.[7][2][1][13]Enteric-coated iron supplements may reduce gastrointestinal side effects, but have lower absorption.[7]"

However, the study participants were malnourished infants in Kenya who were hospitalized, decreasing applicability of results to other populations.[17]Iron supplements will often include vitamin B~12 and folate, since iron deficiency can mask symptoms of a deficiency of either of these vitamins. Vitamin B~12 and/or folate deficiency can cause a dysfunction of RBCs known as macrocytic anemia (where RBCs are enlarged), but this can be masked by iron deficiency (which would typically make RBCs smaller).It has been shown that individuals with iron deficiency anemia have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of endogenous antioxidants.

ESAs are medicines that help the bone marrow to produce red blood cells; they’re often used in conjunction with oral iron therapy for people who also have a condition such as chronic kidney disease that is causing their iron deficiency anemia.

Signs and symptoms vary according to stage.Early stage:Plaque deposits known asdrusenaccumulate in the retina. Eyesight is typically unaffected.Intermediate stage:Drusen grow larger in size. Blurring of central vision and difficulty seeing in low light may occur, but most people experience no noticeable symptoms.Late/Advanced stage:Drusen grow even larger in size. At this stage most people experience visual symptoms such as blurred vision, loss of color perception, difficulty seeing in low light, and central blindness.Additionally, the late stage is further classified as either dry (a.k.a. geographic atrophy) or wet/neovascular macular degeneration. Wet/neovascular macular degeneration differs from the dry form in that it features abnormal blood vessel growth in the back of the eye. This form is less common, but much more likely to result in blindness.[3]"

Symptoms like diarrhea and mild pain can also be treated short-term with anti-diarrheal medications and acetaminophen. Unfortunately, IBD can also lead to infections, which need to be treated with antibiotics.Exclusive enteral nutrition — which uses specific liquid formulas to meet a patient’s dietary needs — can induce remission, especially in pediatric IBD. Emerging evidence suggests that partial enteral nutrition can prevent flares when a patient is in remission, especially when fed through a nasogastric tube that delivers the formula directly into the stomach through the nose.[8]In some cases, surgery is required to remove sections of the intestine that have become severely damaged. If the entire large intestine is removed, the end of the small intestine will be attached to an internal reservoir or external pouch (called an ostomy bag) to collect stool, or can be rerouted via ileoanal anastomosis (a surgery that enables an individual whose large intestine has been removed to defecate normally).[9][10][11]"

Our body relies on multiple levels of defense. These levels include physical barriers (skin and mucous membranes), inflammatory responseinflammation, cellular response, and cellular adaptation.[1]Moderation and balance in these different levels of defense are key to optimal immune health. When the immune response is inadequate, this can open the door for infection by harmful pathogens. In contrast, an overzealous immune response could break tolerance of the immune system to ‘self’ molecules in the body, resulting inautoimmune disease.

These biomarkers may include: leukocytes,lymphocytes, cytokines,T-cells,natural killer(NK) cells,monocytes,C-reactive protein, and antibodies. An important consideration here is that these biomarkers may be elevated as part of a healthy immune response, for example, to an infection. Concern may be warranted if there is an abnormally high level of inflammatory biomarkers or if they’ve been circulating at a higher than average level for an extended time.[3][4]Beyond blood tests, perceived immune status is a subjective assessment that may be more accessible to those outside of the clinical setting. The Immune Status Questionnaire (ISQ) was published in 2019, and is a validated self-assessment that may help individuals determine if they should seek medical attention, make lifestyle changes, or take further action to improve immune health.[5]"

Moderate exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits on immune health. Although physical activity is a stressor that does incite an immune response, the degree of the immune response and whether it’s harmful or helpful to immune health can be situationally dependent.The current understanding is that consistent, moderate to vigorous intensity exercise (<60 minutes in length) is beneficial for immune health and can enhance adaptive immunity, thereby improving protection from community acquired illness and increasing the efficacy of vaccines.[6][7]Muscle contraction is also beneficial to immune health by releasing helpful immune mediators, aiding in lymphatic drainage of waste products, and possibly even diversifying the gut microbiome.[1][8]On the other hand, extreme exercise (especially in the untrained) can be detrimental to immune health. When healing from extreme exercise, the immune system becomes preoccupied and can devote fewer resources to defense.[9]"

Two exceptions to this list are Vitamin D and Garlic, both of which are primarily known for their ability to help the body manage or resist infections. A group of supplements that individually have been studied to a lesser degree on this topic, but that collectively present a noteworthy body of evidence, are adaptogens.

When a person with an allergy is exposed to certain tree nuts, their immune system launches an “attack” against the proteins in the tree nut and can even create antibodies (specificallyimmunoglobulin Eor IgE) that target the nut proteins. This response provokes the rapid development of allergic symptoms, which can affect a variety of body systems and may be mild, moderate, or severe and life-threatening.There are many different kinds of tree nuts, including almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts and walnuts. An allergy to one tree nut does not guarantee an allergy to another, but it is common for people to react to more than one tree nut. Tree nut allergies tend to develop during childhood and are usually lifelong.[1]"

Reactions may include skin involvement (e.g., rashes, swelling, itching); eye discomfort (e.g., itchy, watery, and/or swollen eyes); respiratory difficulties (e.g., shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, throat swelling, hoarseness); gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea); cardiovascular changes (e.g., drops in blood pressure, increased heart rate); and neurological responses, although rare (e.g., fainting, seizures, dizziness).Most signs and symptoms occur within minutes of exposure to tree nuts, although a delayed response of up to 2 hours is possible. Exposure to tree nuts usually happens through ingestion — skin contact or inhalation rarely causes an allergic reaction. When the allergic reaction is very severe and/or involves more than one organ system, it is called an anaphylactic reaction, which can be life-threatening without prompt treatment.[2][3]"

An allergist will use this history in conjunction with a physical exam to guide the choice of additional diagnostic tests.The skin prick test is the most common diagnostic test and involves introducing the allergen into the skin through a small prick with a special tool. If IgE antibodies to tree nuts are present, the area that was pricked will swell. A swollen area 3 mm or greater in size is usually considered positive for an allergy, although some clinicians prefer an 8 mm or greater standard to decrease the chance of a false positive.[4]Blood tests that detect food-specific IgE antibodies may also be used to aid in the diagnosis.Although these diagnostic tests are helpful, they do not predict the severity of a person’s allergic reaction, nor are they useful in people without a history of allergic signs and symptoms (given the frequency of false positives). In some cases, an oral food challenge, which consists of gradual consumption of the allergen under direct medical supervision, may be recommended to confirm the allergy.[5][6]Ideally, allergy testing is done yearly because some allergies change or resolve over time."

People with tree nut allergies need to carefully plan their diets to avoid eating certain tree nuts. This means also avoiding foods that contain or may be contaminated with tree nuts, such as food products made in facilities that use nuts in other products, which is a potential source of cross-contamination. Most countries require that food labels clearly state whether a food contains tree nuts, and many labels voluntarily state whether cross-contamination is possible, so checking the label on all packaged food items is important for people with allergies.Diet may even play a role in allergy prevention. Early introduction of allergenic foods (by approximately 6 months of age) alongside continued consumption reduces the risk of developing food allergies.[15][16][17]"

Withobstructive sleep apnea(OSA), breathing temporarily stops (apnea) due to a constricted airway, in contrast tocentral sleep apnea, where the brain temporarily fails to send signals to the muscles that control breathing.[1]After breathing pauses, the brain triggers a sudden gasp to resume breathing. The stop-start cycle of breathing repeats throughout the night, preventing the body from falling into a deep sleep and reducing oxygen levels. Since OSA tends to take a severe toll on the mind and body, treatment to keep the airway open during sleep is critical to avoiding adverse health consequences."

The sleep partners of people with OSA are usually quite aware of the signs, since the snoring, gasping, and choking can be quite loud. Although snoring is common in people with OSA, it is important to note both that snoring is not an indicator of OSA by itself — snorers do not necessarily have OSA — and also that people can have OSA without being snorers.OSA can cause any of the following symptoms:[1][2]Waking up feeling tired or exhausted in spite of going to bed on timeExtreme daytime sleepinessFeeling irritable, depressed, or anxiousProblems with concentration and focusImpaired memoryDry mouthFrequently waking up during the night to urinateHigh blood pressureMorning headachesChronic eyelid inflammation"

Healthy diets[15]— particularly those with anti-inflammatory potential[16]— have been associated with less OSA risk in observational studies. Specific diet interventions have also shown positive effects in people with OSA. A randomized controlled trial testing a paleo-style diet intervention found that sleep apnea symptoms were reduced by the paleo diet compared to a control low-fat diet, but only in participants on the paleo diet who lost significant amounts of body weight.[17]A randomized controlled trial also found that the Mediterranean diet improved OSA symptoms, regardless of weight loss, when it was combined with a lifestyle intervention that included exercise and healthy sleeping habits.[18]"

Remarkably, 29% of the participants in the lifestyle intervention group achieved complete OSA remission.[21]Reducing alcohol consumption may help to improve sleep apnea symptoms, since higher levels of alcohol consumption are an OSA risk factor.[22]Exercise may also improve OSA symptoms in people with sleep apnea by reducing the accumulation of fluid in tissues surrounding the upper airway at night, which helps to reduce constriction.[23]"

During sleep, muscles become more relaxed, including those in the throat that help to keep the airway open. Although more relaxed, muscles in the throat are normally able to keep the airway open during sleep. In people with OSA, the airway is more constricted and becomes temporarily blocked, preventing breathing.[24]The blockage can be caused by several factors, including individual physiology — some people have naturally narrow airways due to a large tongue, or large tonsils and adenoids. Having a large neck circumference also increases the risk for OSA[25], as does obesity.[26]Chronic inflammation may also play a causal role in developing OSA, but the mechanisms are not well-understood.

However, many overlapping mechanisms can interrupt this signaling cascade.Psychogenic or sympathetic-mediated ED is caused by stress, depression, or anxiety about sexual performance. Neurogenic ED is caused by a deficit in nerve signaling to the penis, which may be secondary to spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or surgery. Vasculogenic ED — the most common form of ED — is caused by underlying vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and structural changes to the arterial walls. Iatrogenic ED is most often the result of pelvic surgery or the use of medications. Finally, endocrine causes of ED include low levels of androgens (e.g., testosterone) and other hormones.A number of medications have been linked to ED, including antihypertensives (blood pressure medications); 5𝛼-reductase inhibitors, anti-androgens, luteinizing hormone-releasing agonists and antagonists (used to treat prostate cancer), antidepressant medications, and opiates.[1]"

It is detected by blood tests that measurethe amount of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream. There is also a blood test that can measure the amount of glucose attached to red blood cells. This is called glycated hemoglobin orhemoglobin A1c(HbA1c), and a high HbA1c is another sign of gestational diabetes. Since red blood cells survive in the bloodstream for about 2 to 3 months, testing the amount of sugar attached to them provides an indication of blood glucose concentrations over the past 2 to 3 months.[7]"

Screening methods vary and may include a one- or two-step approach.[8][9]The two-step approach is more common in the US. Both approaches use an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which involves drinking a sugar-containing beverage and then taking blood samples to see how high blood sugar rises in response to the drink. If blood sugar levels are higher than established normal ranges, gestational diabetes may be diagnosed.Some pregnant people have a higher risk of gestational diabetes and may be screened before 24 weeks gestation to identify pregestational diabetes (diabetes that was present before pregnancy) and early gestational diabetes. The best test for early screening is unclear, but fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c values, and/or OGTT are often used.[9][7]"

It appears to have both a genetic basis[25]as well as environmental and lifestyle triggers (e.g., advanced age, diet, excessive weight gain,obesity, and physical inactivity).[26][27]During pregnancy, the placenta secretes hormones (such asgrowth hormone, placental lactogen,progesterone, and corticotropin-releasing hormone) to ensure the fetus gets all the nutrients it needs. These hormones, alongside other metabolic changes, make the pregnant parent’s body less responsive toinsulin, the hormone that allows glucose to leave the bloodstream and enter the body’s cells.[28]This is calledinsulin resistance. Normally, the pancreas secretes more insulin to combat this resistance and keep blood glucose under control. However, in some pregnant people, the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin to overcome the insulin resistance.[29][26]This causes blood sugar levels to rise beyond what is considered a healthy range and results in a diagnosis of gestational diabetes."

In female adult humans, milk production begins during pregnancy, and lactation continues throughout the postpartum period. Initially, hormones (like progesterone and prolactin) regulate milk production. Milk removal takes on a greater role in stimulating ongoing lactation by four days postpartum, and by ten days postpartum, ongoing lactation is entirely stimulated by removal of milk from the breasts.

Bleeding and scabbing is a common sign of BCC.Squamous cell carcinomas:SCCs are typically pink to red-colored bumps. The affected skin can be scaly and appear inflamed. As with BCCs, SCCs most commonly occur on the face, neck, and other areas with past exposure to ionizing radiation. SCCs are often preceded by red, scaly areas of skin known as actinic keratoses.Melanoma:Melanomas are usually brown to black-colored lesions, resembling a mole, though they can also be pink papules. These lesions are generally asymmetrical, with irregularly-shaped, poorly-defined borders. Melanomas also tend to grow over time, often becoming larger than 6 mm in diameter (roughly the size of a pencil eraser).

As a result, the risk of melanoma is several times higher among light-skinned compared to dark-skinned people.[22]Several drugs and even food-derived compounds are classified as photosensitizing, meaning they increase the skin’s sensitivity to UV light and potentially increase the risk of skin cancer when combined with sunlight exposure.[23]Examples of photosensitizing medications are tetracycline, doxycycline, quinolones, and thiazide diuretics.Finally, because the immune system plays an important role in inhibiting skin cancer development, the use of a number of medications with immunosuppressive effects are associated with a higher risk of skin cancer. This includes TNF-a inhibitors,[24]methotrexate,[25][26]cyclosporin,[27][28]and tacrolimus.[29]As a result of this phenomenon, organ transplant recipients who require immune-supressing medications (to prevent organ rejection) are at a much higher risk of SCC than the general population.[30]"

These hormones affect levels of neurotransmitters such asgamma-aminobutyric acid,dopamine, and serotonin which in turn can affect mood. Some evidence suggests that suppressing estrogen can improve PMS symptoms,[2]and a deficiency of progesterone may worsen symptoms, but more research is needed.[7]"

An estimated 70%–75% of women experience one episode of VVC in their lifetime, and 5%–8% of women are affected by recurrent VVC (defined as four or more episodes in one year).Uncomplicated VVC infections are generally infrequent, mild-to-moderate in severity, occur in women with normal immune function, and resolve with treatment because they're most often caused by the antifungal-sensitive speciesC. albicans. Complicated VVC, however, is characterized by severe, recurrent episodes that occur in women with diseases that increase their risk of infection and are causedCandidaspecies that are harder to treat."

Condoms and hygienic sexual practices (like washing both sex toys and the external genitalia before and after sexual activity) can help prevent VVC from occurring by reducing the transfer of abnormal (or fecal) microbiota into the vagina.[4]"
