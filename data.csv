In healthy people, the immune system is able to distinguish between the self and nonself, a concept called self-tolerance. When the body is functioning properly, the immune system maintains self-tolerance while working in the background to protect the body from infections.In people with autoimmune disease, self-tolerance does not function correctly, causing the body to turn the powerful weapons of the immune system against self molecules, causinginflammationand injury. Autoimmune disease can be systemic, affecting multiple parts of the body, such as in diseases likesystemic lupus erythematosus(SLE). They can also be organ-specific, such as intype 1 diabetes, where the immune system targets and destroys theinsulin-producing cells of the pancreas."

However, more human trials are still needed to provide a better understanding of when, and in whom, these interventions are effective. It is also important to keep in mind that the efficacy and safety of diet interventions will likely vary from person to person, with some potentially being harmful for certain people.Metabolic status in the body is intimately connected to immune function. For example, undernourished people tend to be more susceptible to infections, while the nutrient excess associated with the Western diet may be associated with increased risk of autoimmunity.[1]This suggests that in the future, appropriate diet interventions could potentially help to reduce disease activity in people with active disease, or even lessen disease risk in those who are susceptible."

Doctors will also review the patient’s family medical history to determine whether anybody has been diagnosed with celiac disease. Genetic testing is also often performed to look for gene variants linked to increased disease risk. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of celiac disease is through the detection of specific antibodies in the blood and confirmation of damage tovilli(tiny nutrient-absorbing structures) in the small intestine through a biopsy.[5]It is important to note that a positive diagnosis is only possible after gluten exposure for several weeks before the test. People on gluten-free diets may be advised by their physician to start a “gluten challenge,” which involves several weeks of continuous gluten exposure, since elimination of gluten from the diet can lead to a false-negative diagnosis.[6]"

This rules out any foods that contain wheat, barley, rye, triticale (a cross between wheat and rye), kamut, or farro; this includes semolina, couscous, most cereals, pasta, beers, breads, crackers, wraps, and baked goods. People with celiac disease also need to be careful to avoid hidden exposure to gluten, which can occur with processed foods. For example, processed foods based on corn or rice (neither of which contain gluten) could contain trace amounts of contaminating gluten if they were produced in factories that also make wheat products."

Consuming gluten triggers destruction ofvilli, tiny finger-like projections lining the small intestine that absorb nutrients from food. People who are genetically susceptible have particular variants of the genes encodingmajor histocompatibility complex(MHC) class II molecules, which play a role in the sensing of foreign proteins by the immune system. The MHC class II genes HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 bind to gluten-derived peptides, triggering the immune response that causes intestinal damage. Although HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 seem to be required to develop the disease, they are not sufficient, since only 1% of the population has celiac disease, in spite of 40% having HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8.[12]"

Fistulas, anal fissures, and ulcers can be treated with medication and dietary modifications, but in some cases, severely damaged sections of the intestine may need to be surgically removed and rerouted or attached to a reservoir to enable the passage of stool.Severe symptoms may also require bowel rest, which can involve partial enteral nutrition — using specific liquid formulas to meet a patient’s dietary needs — or delivering nutrients intravenously to bypass the GI tract completely. Partial enteral nutrition may help to prevent flares when a patient is in remission, especially when fed through a nasogastric tube that delivers the formula directly into the stomach through the nose.[4][5]"

Blood tests will be performed to analyze levels of thyroid hormones and check for the presence of particular autoantibodies. Diagnosis can be confirmed through radioactive iodine uptake testing. The thyroid gland absorbsiodineto make thyroid hormones, and in people with Graves’ disease, overproduction of thyroid hormones increases iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, which can be measured with a thyroid scan. Doctors will also use the thyroid scan to analyze the pattern of iodine uptake, which can help to distinguish Graves’ disease from other thyroid disorders.[7]"

However, there are treatment options for hyperthyroidism, including surgery, medications, and radioiodine therapy. Radioiodine therapy involves ingestion of a radioactive form of iodine, which destroys the cells in the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormones. Medications such as beta blockers can reduce some of the symptoms of Graves’ disease, such as rapid heartbeat, tremors, and nervousness. Antithyroid medications that work by reducing the production of thyroid hormones are also commonly prescribed. Surgery is another common treatment for hyperthyroidism and involves removing part or most of the thyroid gland.[7]"

However, therapy often results inhypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland),[7]which could potentially require dietary changes to mitigate weight gain in certain individuals. Hyperthyroidism can also potentially mask a predisposition for weight gain or obesity, which may require diet changes to avoid excessive weight after the hyperthyroidism is treated.[17]"

Commonly used antithyroid therapies are associated with an increased risk that disease symptoms will return after treatment is stopped. The downside to ablative therapies such as radioiodine therapy or surgery is that many people will eventually develop hypothyroidism, which will require lifelong hormone therapy. Immunotherapies designed to treat the underlying autoimmune process that causes Graves’ disease are under development and are being designed with the goal of restoring immune tolerance to some of the self-proteins targeted by autoimmunity. If these immunotherapies are successful, stopping the underlying autoimmune process could potentially restore thyroid hormones back to normal, healthy levels without inducing hypothyroidism. Some of these therapies are being tested in early-phase clinical trials, with promising results.[18]"

It plays a vital role in regulating numerous body functions, including heart rate, body temperature, metabolism, and growth and development, through the production of thyroid hormones that communicate with various cells and tissues in the body.Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause ofhypothyroidism(underactive thyroid) in the U.S. and in other regions of the world with sufficientiodineintake (which is necessary for the thyroid gland to function properly). In people with Hashimoto’s disease, the immune system inappropriately targets the thyroid gland, leading to tissue damage, inflammation and scarring that ultimately decreases thyroid hormone production. The disease often appears in people who are 30-50 years old and is at least 10 times more common in women than men.[1]Hashimoto’s disease is strongly associated with other autoimmune diseases, so your physician may search for other disorders associated with autoimmunity."

BCCs usually occur on the face (e.g., nose, ears, and lip) and neck as well as other areas with past exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., sunlight). Bleeding and scabbing is a common sign of BCC.Squamous cell carcinomas:SCCs are typically pink to red-colored bumps. The affected skin can be scaly and appear inflamed. As with BCCs, SCCs most commonly occur on the face, neck, and other areas with past exposure to ionizing radiation. SCCs are often preceded by red, scaly areas of skin known as actinic keratoses.Melanoma:Melanomas are usually brown to black-colored lesions, resembling a mole, though they can also be pink papules. These lesions are generally asymmetrical, with irregularly-shaped, poorly-defined borders. Melanomas also tend to grow over time, often becoming larger than 6 mm in diameter (roughly the size of a pencil eraser).

Red yeast rice sometimes contains monacolin K, which is identical to the statin lovastatin. For this reason, red yeast rice products containing non-negligible amounts of monacolin K are banned by the FDA since they are a “non-approved drug”.[24][25]If monacolin K is present, red yeast rice may have similar effects and safety profiles to statins.[26][27]However, the methodology for assessing safety in trials is often poor.[27]Additionally,garlicsupplements decrease total cholesterol and LDL-C, though not consistently, with unclear impacts on HDL-C.[28][29]Effects on LDL-C and HDL-C may occur less often when garlic supplements are given alongside a lipid-lowering diet.[30][31][32].Finally,psylliumfiber can have beneficial effects not only on LDL-C, but on non-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels, which may be more predictive of cardiovascular disease than LDL-C.[3]"

After HF is diagnosed, it is then further classified based on severity and type. The two main types, which often have different causes, are:HF with reduced ejection fraction(HFrEF), in which the heart can’t squeeze with enough force to push out all the blood, andHF with preserved ejection fraction(HFpEF), in which the heart can’t fully relax to be filled with enough blood to supply the body.[2][1]"

These hormones, alongside other metabolic changes, make the pregnant parent’s body less responsive toinsulin, the hormone that allows glucose to leave the bloodstream and enter the body’s cells.[28]This is calledinsulin resistance. Normally, the pancreas secretes more insulin to combat this resistance and keep blood glucose under control.

Serumferritintesting is recommended in patients with anemia to diagnose iron deficiency, as it has good accuracy compared to the (invasive) gold standard for diagnosis of bone marrow biopsy. It is the best biochemical test to indicate iron stores, and a ferritin level below 30 micrograms per liter of blood (µg/L) can indicate iron deficiency in anemia.Serum ferritin is also an acute phase reactant — in other words, a marker of inflammation — therefore,C-reactive proteinshould also be measured to rule out a false elevation of ferritin from an inflammatory condition or infection. Depending on the condition, a cutoff value of less than 100 µg/L may be used for ferritin.[4][5][2]Iron deficiency anemia may also show the following signs on bloodwork:Mean corpuscular volume(MCV), a measure of RBC size: less than 80 femtoliters (fL)Mean cell hemoglobin(MCH), a measure of RBC iron content: less than 25 g/dLPercentage transferrin saturation less than 16% (or <20% in the presence of inflammation)[6][5][2]In addition: serum transferrin may be high, serum iron may be low, and total iron-binding capacity may be high.[7][8]If iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, and the clinician suspects it may have a gastrointestinal cause, then tests such as a urea breath test (forH. pyloriinfection), serologic testing for celiac disease (tissue transglutaminase IgA), fecal occult blood testing (i.e., stool sample), upper endoscopy (i.e., viewing the esophagus, stomach, and upper intestines), or colonoscopy may also be performed to investigate for causes of blood loss.[4][7]"

Lower doses of iron may be equally effective while reducing adverse effects.[9][11][12]. Some studies suggest that alternate-day dosing may be superior to consecutive-day dosing for increasing iron absorption.[9]Common side effects of iron supplementation are constipation, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Other oral forms, such as ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, or iron suspensions, may be tolerated better, though there is inconsistent evidence.[7][2][1][13]Enteric-coated iron supplements may reduce gastrointestinal side effects, but have lower absorption.[7]"

However, the study participants were malnourished infants in Kenya who were hospitalized, decreasing applicability of results to other populations.[17]Iron supplements will often include vitamin B~12 and folate, since iron deficiency can mask symptoms of a deficiency of either of these vitamins. Vitamin B~12 and/or folate deficiency can cause a dysfunction of RBCs known as macrocytic anemia (where RBCs are enlarged), but this can be masked by iron deficiency (which would typically make RBCs smaller).It has been shown that individuals with iron deficiency anemia have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of endogenous antioxidants.

ESAs are medicines that help the bone marrow to produce red blood cells; they’re often used in conjunction with oral iron therapy for people who also have a condition such as chronic kidney disease that is causing their iron deficiency anemia.

Signs and symptoms vary according to stage.Early stage:Plaque deposits known asdrusenaccumulate in the retina. Eyesight is typically unaffected.Intermediate stage:Drusen grow larger in size. Blurring of central vision and difficulty seeing in low light may occur, but most people experience no noticeable symptoms.Late/Advanced stage:Drusen grow even larger in size. At this stage most people experience visual symptoms such as blurred vision, loss of color perception, difficulty seeing in low light, and central blindness.Additionally, the late stage is further classified as either dry (a.k.a. geographic atrophy) or wet/neovascular macular degeneration. Wet/neovascular macular degeneration differs from the dry form in that it features abnormal blood vessel growth in the back of the eye. This form is less common, but much more likely to result in blindness.[3]"

Symptoms like diarrhea and mild pain can also be treated short-term with anti-diarrheal medications and acetaminophen. Unfortunately, IBD can also lead to infections, which need to be treated with antibiotics.Exclusive enteral nutrition — which uses specific liquid formulas to meet a patient’s dietary needs — can induce remission, especially in pediatric IBD. Emerging evidence suggests that partial enteral nutrition can prevent flares when a patient is in remission, especially when fed through a nasogastric tube that delivers the formula directly into the stomach through the nose.[8]In some cases, surgery is required to remove sections of the intestine that have become severely damaged. If the entire large intestine is removed, the end of the small intestine will be attached to an internal reservoir or external pouch (called an ostomy bag) to collect stool, or can be rerouted via ileoanal anastomosis (a surgery that enables an individual whose large intestine has been removed to defecate normally).[9][10][11]"

Our body relies on multiple levels of defense. These levels include physical barriers (skin and mucous membranes), inflammatory responseinflammation, cellular response, and cellular adaptation.[1]Moderation and balance in these different levels of defense are key to optimal immune health. When the immune response is inadequate, this can open the door for infection by harmful pathogens. In contrast, an overzealous immune response could break tolerance of the immune system to ‘self’ molecules in the body, resulting inautoimmune disease.

These biomarkers may include: leukocytes,lymphocytes, cytokines,T-cells,natural killer(NK) cells,monocytes,C-reactive protein, and antibodies. An important consideration here is that these biomarkers may be elevated as part of a healthy immune response, for example, to an infection. Concern may be warranted if there is an abnormally high level of inflammatory biomarkers or if they’ve been circulating at a higher than average level for an extended time.[3][4]Beyond blood tests, perceived immune status is a subjective assessment that may be more accessible to those outside of the clinical setting. The Immune Status Questionnaire (ISQ) was published in 2019, and is a validated self-assessment that may help individuals determine if they should seek medical attention, make lifestyle changes, or take further action to improve immune health.[5]"

Moderate exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits on immune health. Although physical activity is a stressor that does incite an immune response, the degree of the immune response and whether it’s harmful or helpful to immune health can be situationally dependent.The current understanding is that consistent, moderate to vigorous intensity exercise (<60 minutes in length) is beneficial for immune health and can enhance adaptive immunity, thereby improving protection from community acquired illness and increasing the efficacy of vaccines.[6][7]Muscle contraction is also beneficial to immune health by releasing helpful immune mediators, aiding in lymphatic drainage of waste products, and possibly even diversifying the gut microbiome.[1][8]On the other hand, extreme exercise (especially in the untrained) can be detrimental to immune health. When healing from extreme exercise, the immune system becomes preoccupied and can devote fewer resources to defense.[9]"

Two exceptions to this list are Vitamin D and Garlic, both of which are primarily known for their ability to help the body manage or resist infections. A group of supplements that individually have been studied to a lesser degree on this topic, but that collectively present a noteworthy body of evidence, are adaptogens.

When a person with an allergy is exposed to certain tree nuts, their immune system launches an “attack” against the proteins in the tree nut and can even create antibodies (specificallyimmunoglobulin Eor IgE) that target the nut proteins. This response provokes the rapid development of allergic symptoms, which can affect a variety of body systems and may be mild, moderate, or severe and life-threatening.There are many different kinds of tree nuts, including almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts and walnuts. An allergy to one tree nut does not guarantee an allergy to another, but it is common for people to react to more than one tree nut. Tree nut allergies tend to develop during childhood and are usually lifelong.[1]"

Reactions may include skin involvement (e.g., rashes, swelling, itching); eye discomfort (e.g., itchy, watery, and/or swollen eyes); respiratory difficulties (e.g., shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, throat swelling, hoarseness); gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea); cardiovascular changes (e.g., drops in blood pressure, increased heart rate); and neurological responses, although rare (e.g., fainting, seizures, dizziness).Most signs and symptoms occur within minutes of exposure to tree nuts, although a delayed response of up to 2 hours is possible. Exposure to tree nuts usually happens through ingestion — skin contact or inhalation rarely causes an allergic reaction. When the allergic reaction is very severe and/or involves more than one organ system, it is called an anaphylactic reaction, which can be life-threatening without prompt treatment.[2][3]"

An allergist will use this history in conjunction with a physical exam to guide the choice of additional diagnostic tests.The skin prick test is the most common diagnostic test and involves introducing the allergen into the skin through a small prick with a special tool. If IgE antibodies to tree nuts are present, the area that was pricked will swell. A swollen area 3 mm or greater in size is usually considered positive for an allergy, although some clinicians prefer an 8 mm or greater standard to decrease the chance of a false positive.[4]Blood tests that detect food-specific IgE antibodies may also be used to aid in the diagnosis.Although these diagnostic tests are helpful, they do not predict the severity of a person’s allergic reaction, nor are they useful in people without a history of allergic signs and symptoms (given the frequency of false positives). In some cases, an oral food challenge, which consists of gradual consumption of the allergen under direct medical supervision, may be recommended to confirm the allergy.[5][6]Ideally, allergy testing is done yearly because some allergies change or resolve over time."

People with tree nut allergies need to carefully plan their diets to avoid eating certain tree nuts. This means also avoiding foods that contain or may be contaminated with tree nuts, such as food products made in facilities that use nuts in other products, which is a potential source of cross-contamination. Most countries require that food labels clearly state whether a food contains tree nuts, and many labels voluntarily state whether cross-contamination is possible, so checking the label on all packaged food items is important for people with allergies.Diet may even play a role in allergy prevention. Early introduction of allergenic foods (by approximately 6 months of age) alongside continued consumption reduces the risk of developing food allergies.[15][16][17]"

Withobstructive sleep apnea(OSA), breathing temporarily stops (apnea) due to a constricted airway, in contrast tocentral sleep apnea, where the brain temporarily fails to send signals to the muscles that control breathing.[1]After breathing pauses, the brain triggers a sudden gasp to resume breathing. The stop-start cycle of breathing repeats throughout the night, preventing the body from falling into a deep sleep and reducing oxygen levels. Since OSA tends to take a severe toll on the mind and body, treatment to keep the airway open during sleep is critical to avoiding adverse health consequences."

The sleep partners of people with OSA are usually quite aware of the signs, since the snoring, gasping, and choking can be quite loud. Although snoring is common in people with OSA, it is important to note both that snoring is not an indicator of OSA by itself — snorers do not necessarily have OSA — and also that people can have OSA without being snorers.OSA can cause any of the following symptoms:[1][2]Waking up feeling tired or exhausted in spite of going to bed on timeExtreme daytime sleepinessFeeling irritable, depressed, or anxiousProblems with concentration and focusImpaired memoryDry mouthFrequently waking up during the night to urinateHigh blood pressureMorning headachesChronic eyelid inflammation"

Healthy diets[15]— particularly those with anti-inflammatory potential[16]— have been associated with less OSA risk in observational studies. Specific diet interventions have also shown positive effects in people with OSA. A randomized controlled trial testing a paleo-style diet intervention found that sleep apnea symptoms were reduced by the paleo diet compared to a control low-fat diet, but only in participants on the paleo diet who lost significant amounts of body weight.[17]A randomized controlled trial also found that the Mediterranean diet improved OSA symptoms, regardless of weight loss, when it was combined with a lifestyle intervention that included exercise and healthy sleeping habits.[18]"

Remarkably, 29% of the participants in the lifestyle intervention group achieved complete OSA remission.[21]Reducing alcohol consumption may help to improve sleep apnea symptoms, since higher levels of alcohol consumption are an OSA risk factor.[22]Exercise may also improve OSA symptoms in people with sleep apnea by reducing the accumulation of fluid in tissues surrounding the upper airway at night, which helps to reduce constriction.[23]"

During sleep, muscles become more relaxed, including those in the throat that help to keep the airway open. Although more relaxed, muscles in the throat are normally able to keep the airway open during sleep. In people with OSA, the airway is more constricted and becomes temporarily blocked, preventing breathing.[24]The blockage can be caused by several factors, including individual physiology — some people have naturally narrow airways due to a large tongue, or large tonsils and adenoids. Having a large neck circumference also increases the risk for OSA[25], as does obesity.[26]Chronic inflammation may also play a causal role in developing OSA, but the mechanisms are not well-understood.

However, many overlapping mechanisms can interrupt this signaling cascade.Psychogenic or sympathetic-mediated ED is caused by stress, depression, or anxiety about sexual performance. Neurogenic ED is caused by a deficit in nerve signaling to the penis, which may be secondary to spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or surgery. Vasculogenic ED — the most common form of ED — is caused by underlying vascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, and structural changes to the arterial walls. Iatrogenic ED is most often the result of pelvic surgery or the use of medications. Finally, endocrine causes of ED include low levels of androgens (e.g., testosterone) and other hormones.A number of medications have been linked to ED, including antihypertensives (blood pressure medications); 5𝛼-reductase inhibitors, anti-androgens, luteinizing hormone-releasing agonists and antagonists (used to treat prostate cancer), antidepressant medications, and opiates.[1]"

It is detected by blood tests that measurethe amount of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream. There is also a blood test that can measure the amount of glucose attached to red blood cells. This is called glycated hemoglobin orhemoglobin A1c(HbA1c), and a high HbA1c is another sign of gestational diabetes. Since red blood cells survive in the bloodstream for about 2 to 3 months, testing the amount of sugar attached to them provides an indication of blood glucose concentrations over the past 2 to 3 months.[7]"

Screening methods vary and may include a one- or two-step approach.[8][9]The two-step approach is more common in the US. Both approaches use an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which involves drinking a sugar-containing beverage and then taking blood samples to see how high blood sugar rises in response to the drink. If blood sugar levels are higher than established normal ranges, gestational diabetes may be diagnosed.Some pregnant people have a higher risk of gestational diabetes and may be screened before 24 weeks gestation to identify pregestational diabetes (diabetes that was present before pregnancy) and early gestational diabetes. The best test for early screening is unclear, but fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c values, and/or OGTT are often used.[9][7]"

It appears to have both a genetic basis[25]as well as environmental and lifestyle triggers (e.g., advanced age, diet, excessive weight gain,obesity, and physical inactivity).[26][27]During pregnancy, the placenta secretes hormones (such asgrowth hormone, placental lactogen,progesterone, and corticotropin-releasing hormone) to ensure the fetus gets all the nutrients it needs. These hormones, alongside other metabolic changes, make the pregnant parent’s body less responsive toinsulin, the hormone that allows glucose to leave the bloodstream and enter the body’s cells.[28]This is calledinsulin resistance. Normally, the pancreas secretes more insulin to combat this resistance and keep blood glucose under control. However, in some pregnant people, the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin to overcome the insulin resistance.[29][26]This causes blood sugar levels to rise beyond what is considered a healthy range and results in a diagnosis of gestational diabetes."

In female adult humans, milk production begins during pregnancy, and lactation continues throughout the postpartum period. Initially, hormones (like progesterone and prolactin) regulate milk production. Milk removal takes on a greater role in stimulating ongoing lactation by four days postpartum, and by ten days postpartum, ongoing lactation is entirely stimulated by removal of milk from the breasts.

Bleeding and scabbing is a common sign of BCC.Squamous cell carcinomas:SCCs are typically pink to red-colored bumps. The affected skin can be scaly and appear inflamed. As with BCCs, SCCs most commonly occur on the face, neck, and other areas with past exposure to ionizing radiation. SCCs are often preceded by red, scaly areas of skin known as actinic keratoses.Melanoma:Melanomas are usually brown to black-colored lesions, resembling a mole, though they can also be pink papules. These lesions are generally asymmetrical, with irregularly-shaped, poorly-defined borders. Melanomas also tend to grow over time, often becoming larger than 6 mm in diameter (roughly the size of a pencil eraser).

As a result, the risk of melanoma is several times higher among light-skinned compared to dark-skinned people.[22]Several drugs and even food-derived compounds are classified as photosensitizing, meaning they increase the skin’s sensitivity to UV light and potentially increase the risk of skin cancer when combined with sunlight exposure.[23]Examples of photosensitizing medications are tetracycline, doxycycline, quinolones, and thiazide diuretics.Finally, because the immune system plays an important role in inhibiting skin cancer development, the use of a number of medications with immunosuppressive effects are associated with a higher risk of skin cancer. This includes TNF-a inhibitors,[24]methotrexate,[25][26]cyclosporin,[27][28]and tacrolimus.[29]As a result of this phenomenon, organ transplant recipients who require immune-supressing medications (to prevent organ rejection) are at a much higher risk of SCC than the general population.[30]"

For daily fasting of set durations, the term “time-restricted eating” is preferred. For the sake of this page, the terms will be used interchangeably.
Although 16:8 is a fairly mild protocol when it comes to time-restricted eating/intermittent fasting, it could have differing effects based on age and sex, so working with a dietitian and/or physician to see how it could affect you may be prudent.Time-restricted eating is often described as the ratio of hours spent abstaining from food and the hours where eating is permitted.16:8 is a particular time-restricted eating protocol in which individuals abstain from any caloric intake for 16 hours, and then eat freely for 8 hours. Other popular schedules include 18:6, 20:4, and one-meal-a-day (OMAD).Previously, these types of eating schedules fell under the category of “intermittent fasting”, but now that term generally refers to eating schedules that involve abstaining from or drastically lowering energy intake for more than 24 hours. Time-restricted eating can involve a caloric deficit[1]to lose weight, but doesn’t have to.[2]16:8 is a type of time-restricted eating where you abstain from eating for sixteen hours, and then eat freely for the remaining eight.

This means that 7,8-DHF could theoretically cause similar effects as BDNF in the brain, and in theory be more therapeutically useful due to its better absorption and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.When the TrkB receptor is activated, neurons tend to experience growth and protective effects. The growth tends to affect thedendritesof the neuron which reach out into the synapse to communicate with subsequent neurons, and 7,8-DHF has shown an ability to promote the growth of these dendrites into the synapse to help restore communication between neurons in animal models of cognitive decline (Alzheimer's and aging being researched). Some other supplements such asbacopa monnieriandpolygala tenuifoliatend to work via activating this receptor via releasing BDNF in the brain.There is a possible nootropic use of this flavonoid in otherwise healthy subjects, but the cognitive benefits seen in cognitively unwell rodents may not correlate well to healthy subjects.

Its root has a horsey smell and is said to confer the strength and virility of a horse. In Sanskrit, ashva means “horse” and gandha means “smell.”[310]Various parts of the plant are used, but the most common supplemental form is an extract of its roots. Its use as part of the Ayurvedic system usually involves more than just the herb alone.Ashwagandha is classified as an adaptogen, meaning it’s purported to enhance the body’s resilience to stress. Rodent and cell culture studies suggest that ashwagandha may provide a wide range of health benefits,[311][312]but evidence in human studies has thus far varied depending on the health state and population of interest.[313][314][315][316][317][307]"

There is increasing support for the use of ashwagandha in the context of health states that are typically affected by a chronic stress response.reference Ashwagandha research in cardio-respiratory and musculoskeletal performance enhancements has shown promise for both athletes and non-athletes.[187][326][327][328][329][317][307]Similarly, ashwagandha may also improveimmune health, women’s health, men’s health, andsexual health.

A majority of the related studies focus on stress and stress-related conditions, which are frequently tied tocortisol, other neuroendocrine hormones, and neurotransmitters. Much research has been devoted to understanding the ability of ashwagandha to mitigate the effects of both healthy and detrimental stress, which, in turn, could affect other outcomes and or health states.Anxiety,depression,fertility,obesity, sleep,exercise recovery,immune health, andcognitionare just a few examples. The HPA stress response may also explain some of the varied results seen in the body of evidence. This variance could be the result of ashwagandha affecting the HPA axis differently in different people. It may also be due to the complex relationship between stress and health conditions. If stress isn’t the precipitating factor for a negative health state, ashwagandha may not be an effective treatment for it either.The strongest evidence to date suggests ashwagandha has cortisol and corticosteroid lowering effects.[338][310][323][320][322][324][321][339][340][341]In studies where cortisol was lowered, other outcomes, such asanxiety, weight management,fertility,cognition, sleep, and/orquality of life, have also shown some improvement.[324][321][340][323][339][310][320][322]"

Note that while studies may use standardized extracts or proprietary formulas, variations in extraction methods, formulation, or composition can affect physiological response.Evidence suggests that 600 mg daily is superior to lower doses for improving sleep.[306]Similarly, 600–1,000 mg daily may be more beneficial than lower doses for athletes undergoing an intensive exercise regimen.[307]However, more research is needed to confirm whether doses above 600 mg daily yield greater benefits.It is unknown if ashwagandha loses its potency with daily long-term usage, but due to its possible drug-like effects on neurotransmission, this possibility cannot be ruled out.

There is limited evidence in humans currently, so most conclusions are based upon animal models andin vitroresearch.It does appear to have some promise for the purpose of bone regeneration in several rat models of menopause, and this appears to be traceable to several different molecules; the class of prenylated isoflavones appears to enhance bone cell differentiation and said rat studies have confirmed an increase in bone mass.There are two studies in rats suggesting a possible anti-stress and anti-depressant effect, although they are not to a remarkable degree. The mechanisms of Bakuchiol and its derivatives are highly catecholamine (dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline) based, and there is possibility of interactions between Psoralea and classical stimulants.Beyond the promise but currently unproven benefits to cognition and bone mass, Psoralea has interesting mechanisms in regards to inducing apoptosis in cancer cells (the anti-cancer effects).

31a6d59a-8bca-43b1-b176-58177464e819,https://examine.com/supplements/betaine/,Betaine,Summary,"Trimethylglycine (TMG) is a molecule which, structurally, is the amino acidglycinewith three methyl groups attached to it. It is known as a ""betaine"" molecule (""betaine"" being a category of molecules), but because it was the first dietary betaine discovered (frombeetroot) and is the most popular molecule referred to as a betaine, the terms ""trimethylglycine"" and ""betaine"" are used interchangeably.One of betaine's major mechanisms is its role as a methyl donor. Betaine either directly donates a methyl group to reduce homocysteine into L-methionine or it increases bodily levels ofS-adenosyl methionine(SAMe) or active folate molecules, both of which can go on to donate methyl groups to other parts of the body.Evidence in humans indicates that betaine effectively and reliably reduces homocysteine levels in both healthy people and people with various conditions.[1][2]However, betaine also appears to increase total and LDL-cholesterol at high doses (> 4 g per day).[2]Elevated homocysteine levels have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular events in several observational studies. However, correlation does not indicate causation. Although it is thought that reducing homocysteine levels is cardioprotective, interventions that lower homocysteine levels don’t seem to prevent cardiovascular events in people with cardiovascular disease.[3]Betaine's other major mechanism is it acts as an osmolyte, or a molecule that is shuttled in and out of a cell to affect its hydration status. Similar tocreatine, increased intracellular concentrations of betaine promote cell hydration and resilience to stressors.Betaine (also known as TMG) is an ""osmolyte"", a molecule that regulates water balance in cells. Betaine can directly methylate homocysteine, which is potentially cardioprotective. It also indirectly affects folate and SAMe metabolism to support whole-body methylation.Elsewhere, mechanistic evidence demonstrates that betaine is effective for preventing and improvingnonalcoholic fatty liver disease,[4]but there is a lack of studies in humans. Two 1-year trials in participants withnonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH) observed an improvement in liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis with a dosage of 10 g of betaine twice per day (20 g total), but there was no control group in either study.[5][6]A more recent 1-year randomized controlled trial in participants with NASH reportedno improvementin liver fat, inflammation, or fibrosis with a dosage of 10 g of betaine twice per day.[7]Finally, there is mixed evidence on the efficacy of betaine as a performance-enhancing compound. Most studies report that supplementation with betaine does not enhance maximal strength or power.[8]Betaine also doesn’t seem to enhance resistance exercise performance when low volumes (1–3 sets) are performed.[9][10]However, there is evidence to suggest that betaine enhances resistance exercise performance in protocols that challenge muscular endurance with high levels of metabolic stress.[11][12]The mechanism by which betaine may improve resistance exercise performance in this specific context is unclear, but it may be due to betaine’s ability to attenuate increases in lactate levels during exercise.[11][12][13]It’s also hypothesized that betaine’s osmolytic effects help to enhance resistance exercise performance during high-volume training. Even so, this may be of no practical relevance becausecreatineshares this mechanism of action, and the lone study to evaluate supplementation with betaine and creatine failed to find an additive effect of betaine on creatine’s benefits.[14]"

In healthy people, a daily dose of 1.5–3 g might be just as effective as higher doses.[2]A dosage of 2.5 g, typically split into two 1.25 g doses, has been used to improve resistance exercise performance.Studies on liver fat and fibrosis have used a dosage of 20 g per day, divided into two 10 g doses.High doses of betaine seem to be well tolerated by most people, but like any osmolyte, it can cause diarrhea at high doses. High doses of betaine can also increase total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels."

A monaural beat is formed when these tones are combined before they are played through a speaker, whereas a binaural beat is formed when each tone is played separately into each ear, producing a perceived third tone that is equal to the difference between the two base tones. For example, an individual may have a 240 Hz tone played in one ear and a 245 Hz tone played in the other, which will produce the illusion of a third 5 Hz tone.Binaural beats are an auditory illusion produced by playing two slightly different tones into each ear, and are tuned to the frequency of certain brainwaves to produce a desired effect."

Although it is technically known as vitamin B7, this designation is not too common as it is usually simply referred to as biotin.It was initially found to be a component of nails, skin, and hair to a relatively high degree. Biotin has been seen as the go-to vitamin for beauty ever since one pilot study in women with brittle nails showed supplementation to be beneficial. It is currently being marketed for improving nail, skin, and hair aesthetics. These claims, however, were not followed up scientifically so there is not much evidence to support biotin's role here. It can plausibly have these actions mechanistically, but there is simply not much evidence that can be used as support.Beyond that, biotin's general role as an enzymatic cofactor has also led to some research suggesting it may interact with glucose metabolism in the human body. As a general statement, it seems that in rodents with a higher circulating biotin level in their blood, the amount of insulin released in response to a glucose test is higher, leading to less elevation of glucose over time. This rodent evidence also reports that the higher glucose isnotmet with higher insulin resistance, suggesting a potentially beneficial role.Not too much evidence has been conducted in humans in regard to diabetes, with one study finding that intramuscular biotin was able to attenuate symptoms of neuropathy in three diabetic subjects.Overall, aside from instances where biotin may be deficient (alcoholism, some epileptic drug therapies, and overconsumption of raw egg whites) the supplement does not have any solid evidence for benefits andmayhave a role as a beauty supplement pending better evidence."

Through its active component Piperine, Black Pepper is able to modify supplement and drug metabolism.A process in the liver called glucuronidation, which attaches a molecule (glucuronide) to drugs to signal for their urinary excretion, is inhibited with piperine. This process prevents excessive levels of drugs and supplements in the body, but sometimes inhibits all uptake and renders some supplements useless. In the scenario of piperine ingestion, excretion of supplements is hindered and certain drugs and supplements can bypass this regulatory stage (as not all are subject to it).This is good in some cases, as Piperine is required to givecurcuminto the extremities rather than it getting consumed by glucuronidation in the liver. However, in some other cases it can lead to elevated levels of certain drugs in the blood. Again, elevated could be good or bad depending on context; regardless, caution should be taken when approaching this compound."

It has most usage for medicine in Ayurvedic medicine, some reading into Traditional Chinese Medicine, and its usage extends to the Middle East and other tropical regions.Boswellia serrata, via its active boswellic acids, appears to be a novel inhibitory of a pro-inflammatory enzyme called 5-Lipoxygenase and may possess other anti-inflammatory effects (such as nF-kB inhibition, which are not as novel). These anti-inflammatory effects have been investigated for their benefits inosteoarthritis(OA), and it appears that oral Boswellia supplements can suppress pain and immobility associated with OA quite significantly with the effects taking as little as a week to occur. The studies are well conducted, but funded by the producers of the tested supplements. There are limited non-funded interventions with Boswellic for this claim, but they seem to agree with the battery of funded study in effect size.Remarkably, Boswellia appears to be quite anti-cancer that appears to be more anti-proliferative rather than apoptotic (the latter meaning to induce regulated cell death) since it is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and cell invasiveness. There are not a large battery of studies on these claims, but preliminary mouse and rat evidence where the rodents are injected with tumors suggest that Boswellia can potently suppress tumor growth (Pancreatic, Colorectal) and in some cases actually outright prevent tumor growth (Prostatic, Glioma). Boswellia appears to be a very promising anti-cancer herb due to the potency it exhibits in animals, with one study noting this after oral administration (100mg/kg of the main boswellic acid in animals). The potency has been replicated in other cancer cell linesin vitro(including breast, cervical, myeloma and leukemia) but these cancers do not yet have animal interventions yet.Boswellia appears to be fairly nontoxic, has a history of usage as a phytopharmaceutical for brain edema associated with radiotherapy (a cancer treatment), and the general anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects make it a fairly interesting herb relative to others that have subpar evidence."

A few flavonoids in this plant (Cajanin and Cladrin in particular) and one other molecule (Medicarpin) are structureally similar to isoflavones, and appear to be very potent at promoting bone health. Studies using these moleculesin vitrohave noted their effective doses compare with that of estrogen itself and they are just as potent (if not nonsignificantly more potent) at promoting bone growth; despite the potency, medicarpin is only slightly estrogenic and both Cajanin and Cladrin appear to be nonestrogenic.Cajanin, Cladrin, Medicarpin, and one other flavonoid known as Isoformononetin all appear to be highly active in rats following an oral dose of 10mg/kg (human equivalent of 1.6mg/kg), and have been noted to fully prevent bone losses assocaited with menopause with daily ingestion.

It has the same structure whether it’s incoffee,energy drinks,tea, or pills.Caffeine is a powerful stimulant, and it can be used to improve physical strength and endurance. It is classified as a nootropic because it sensitizes neurons and provides mental stimulation.Habitual caffeine use is also associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease,cirrhosis, andliver cancer.Caffeine’s main mechanism concerns antagonizing adenosine receptors. Adenosine causes sedation and relaxation when it acts upon its receptors, located in the brain. Caffeine prevents this action and causesalertnessandwakefulness. This inhibition of adenosine can influence thedopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and adrenaline systems.For practical tips on the optimal use of caffeine, check out ourSupplement Guides."

It is a macromineral due to the relatively large amounts required in the diet (at times exceeding a gram a day) and is predominately found in dairy products and vegetables. Similar to many other nutrients, calcium does follow the general advice of ""if the diet is sufficient in calcium then supplementation is unnecessary"" and excessive intakes of calcium do not promote greater benefits to health and may simply promote constipation.The major benefit of calcium is preventative, mitigating the risk of developing osteoporosis during the aging process. Osteoporosis can be at least partially seen as a condition resulting from long-term calcium insufficiency and, while not fully preventative, maintaining adequate calcium intake throughout life is associated with significantly reduced risk.Calcium can come from any source be it supplementation, food, or even food-derivatives such aswhey protein. Each form does have their benefits and drawbacks, such as coral calcium technically being better absorbed than calcium carbonate, but due to calcium's ability to be absorbed at all points in the intestine the issue of calcium absorption is one that is greatly influenced by the diet. Diets high in fermentable fibers (usually found in vegetables) and high enough in bulk and fiber to slow the rate at which food passes through the intestines increase calcium absorption; simply taking a calcium supplement on top of a low fiber/low bulk diet will not be as effective as consuming the calcium through dairy or even vegetables."

The process of 'glucuronidation' is a detoxification process where a group (known as a glucuronide) is attached to a hydrophobic molecule to make it more water soluble, and then the kidneys can better facilitate its removal from the body. This process is positively mediated by theglucuronosyltransferaseenzyme, and negatively mediated by theβ-glucuronidaseenzyme; as such, inhibiting the negative regulator (the enzyme that removes the glucuronide) indirectly increases the activity of this pathway.It is touted to be an anticancer agent, which is due to a series of past research done in rats and mice exposed to the DMBA toxin which is known to be glucuronidated. There are definitely anticancer effects in these models, and it appears to extend to other toxins that are glucuronidated.However, a problem occurs when humans take this as an oral supplement. Although it appears to be safe even at high doses, very high doses are required for its effects (100mg/kg minimum, near maximal effects at 200mg/kg) and this would even only theoretically assure some protection against toxins that are glucuronidated. If a toxin can't be glucuronidated and requires another detoxification pathway, it will serve no benefit.Organ cancer production which just occurs spontaneously because of oxidative stress to DNA is also not likely to be protected against, as increasing glucuronidation does notper sedecrease oxidative stress in the body (it might just reduce the oxidative effects of toxins).Furthermore, all steroid hormones in the body (testosterone, estrogen,DHEA, etc.) are also glucuronidated. If using an oral dose that reduces the toxin, these hormones will also all be reduced for a short time.Using calcium-D-glucarate as a daily preventative supplement does not appear to be a prudent idea, due to its lack of reliability even in theory and high doses used. However, a single acute dose of this supplement prior toknownexposure to toxins that are glucuronidated (such as both benzopyrene and polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds produced in the cooking of meat products) might be more prudent and potentially useful."

41ed2f5f-bfcb-4ce9-8b77-2056a362aa1e,https://examine.com/supplements/cannabis/,Cannabis,Summary,"Cannabis is the common name for a few plants in thecannabisgenus, includingsativa,indica, andruderalis. It is primarily used for its psychoactive properties around the world. Cannabis has also been traditionally used to treat inflammatory disorders and is increasingly being used in modern medicine.Cannabis' primary active chemical, Δ9THC, ordelta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, acts on the cannabinergic system in the body, which is actually named cannabis after the plant. This system is regulated by two receptors, called cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2). CB1 is responsible for most of the psychoactive effects of cannabis, and CB2 is responsible for many of the long-term benefits cannabis may provide for inflammation and related diseases.THC and CBD appear to be notable analgesics and can reduce pain in a variety of health conditions. Pain in multiple sclerosis and neuropathic pain, in general, have the best evidence for benefits, and they also appear to be useful in cancer, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and pain from wounds. However, more research on those is needed. There is great interest in using cannabis to reduce opioid use, and while some evidence supports this, more research is needed to determine where it may be most effective. In instances of severe pain, the reduction in pain may not be enough to reduce opioid use.Inhaling cannabis smoke increases diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, though this change is temporary. However, many case studies note cannabis usage 30 – 60 minutes before heart attacks, so it's possible that this acute effect could be dangerous for those at high risk. Heart attacks can occur when people with an elevated risk for heart disease push their blood pressure and heart rate to dangerous levels. It may also interact with some pharmaceuticals, which could result in elevated blood pressure and a heart attack. Smoking cannabis has also been associated with bronchitis.Cannabis usage over a long period of time can cause tolerance and subsequently withdrawal. Cannabis withdrawal is recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). On a molecular level, cannabis tolerance occurs when the CB1 receptor is overstimulated and internalized, meaning absorbed by the cell. The CB1 receptor and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor are linked when it comes to cannabis, so when CB1 signaling is inhibited, NMDA signaling is also hampered. This may cause cannabis to be less effective for treating epilepsy and schizophrenia, though it also reduces the memory loss associated with cannabis use. Tolerance does not significantly affect the CB2 receptor, so cannabis may be effective for inflammatory disorders over a longer period of time.Note:Originally, this page included various studies on isolated THC. We have decided to transition the Examine Database of this page to one that exclusively includes studies on combinations of THC and CBD, either in the form of whole cannabis leaf, cannabis oil, or pharmaceutical combinations of THC and CBD. We have a dedicatedCBDpage and hope to release a dedicated THC page in the not-too-distant future.In one sense, this should provide us a better way to understand the expected effects of different products. On the other hand, because a large amount of clinical research is in isolated and synthetic THC, this page by itself is insufficient, in a sense. Various painful conditions that respond to isolated THC could also benefit the same dose of THC from whole cannabis or a THC/CBD product, as the addition of CBD or the other parts of cannabis will be unlikely to counteract those effects; if anything CBD appears to be a notable analgesic in its own right. So when you're using this page, know that there's a good chance that there is more research on isolated THC or CBD for various outcomes (especially chemotherapy side-effects).This page is also incomplete because we have omitted some research that we didn't find to be particularly useful for this page. This included a vast literature on the psychological and cognitive effects of cannabis, largely when taken acutely. It also included various studies on health conditions where there were very few applicable studies, though these will be added next update."

Once Chaga infects a tree trunk, it can grow there for up to 80 years. The mushroom has been used for centuries and is often touted as a cure-all within the realm of alternative medicine: from gastrointestinal diseases to cancer, there are few ailments for which Chaga has not been used as a potential remedy.[1]What are the potential benefits of Chaga?Chaga contains a wide variety of potentially beneficial chemical compounds, such as polyphenols, melanin, triterpenoids, and polysaccharides. Among these, polysaccharides are the most well researched.[2]Currently, there is lab-based research that suggests Chaga may have a number of desirable effects:Cancer:Chaga has shown anticancer properties in bothin vitroandin vivo(i.e., animal-based) research, inhibiting cancer cell replication and stimulating anticancer activity in the immune system.[3][4]Viral infections:Chaga can impair a virus’s ability to enter target cellsin vitro, an effect that has been studied in feline viruses, herpes simplex, and hepatitis C.[5][6][7]Oxidative stress & Inflammation:The polysaccharides present in Chaga can reduce markers of oxidative stress and inflammationin vitro.[8][9][10][11]Fatigue:Chaga was able to lower fatigue in exercising mice.[12][13]Gut Health:Chaga improved markers of gut health and the gut microbiome in mice with chronic pancreatitis.[14]Are there any human studies using Chaga?To date, the only study on the effects of Chaga in humans is a case series (a study that looks at a group of people receiving the same treatment) from 1973.In this study, 50 people with both gastrointestinal disease and psoriasis either consumed Chaga orally (1 tablespoon, 3 times per day) or applied it topically (the dosage and duration were not reported). The primary outcome was the improvement in psoriasis lesions. 38 participants were considered completely cured, 8 participants showed improvement, and 4 participants showed no effect.[15]Considering the age of the study, lack of control group, no randomization, and no standardized measurement of psoriasis disease progression, more human research is needed to determine the utility of Chaga.Is Chaga safe?The safety data for Chaga is limited.The main concern is that it contains high levels of oxalate (a compound commonly found in plants that can cause kidney stones).[16]While anecdotal evidence suggests it is relatively safe, there are two case reports of oxalate-induced kidney disease (a condition that occurs due to the buildup of calcium-oxalate crystals within the kidney) after long-term consumption of Chaga.[17][18]One case study found that a 49-year-old man with no other diseases developed end-stage renal disease after consuming Chaga daily for 5 years.[17]However, he had also consumed more than double the recommended manufacturer dose.[17]Another case study reported that a 72-year-old woman with liver cancer developed oxalate-induced kidney disease after 6 months of consuming 4–5 teaspoons of Chaga daily.[18]It is believed that the high oxalate content of Chaga — one study found there are 6.72–97.59 milligrams (mg) of oxalate per gram of Chaga[16]— caused kidney disease in these two cases.Is Chaga a psychedelic?No. Although Chaga is a mushroom, it doesn’t have any psychoactive compounds.[16]Can Chaga be consumed while pregnant or breastfeeding?Given there are few human studies using Chaga, it is difficult to determine its safety for pregnant or breastfeeding women. As such, it is not recommended to consume Chaga while pregnant or breastfeeding unless directed by a healthcare provider.Does Chaga have any side effects?Unfortunately, there are no human studies directly investigating the side effects of Chaga.Does Chaga interact with any medications?There is some lab-based evidence that Chaga may have similar mechanisms of action (the way a substance produces an effect) to blood thinners[19]and diabetic medications.[20]Therefore, it is best to consult your healthcare provider before supplementing with Chaga.Can other supplements raise blood oxalate levels?Supplementing with high doses of vitamin C (>1,000 mg/day) can increase the excretion of oxalates from the kidneys.[21]This could increase the risk of kidney stones or kidney disease. Several case studies have reported oxalate-induced kidney disease due to vitamin C supplementation.[22][23][24]It’s important to note that in all of these cases of kidney disease, people were supplementing with doses ranging from 480–5,000 mg, which would suggest that the dose of vitamin C needed to cause kidney disease would differ from person to person."

Its traditional usages are mostly catered around treating feminine disorders (menopause, libido, and menstrual disorders) or treating bones (increasing bone mass or accelerating fracture healing rates) which gives it the traditional name of the 'Bone Setter'; some other traditional usages are in regards to its supposed antiulcer properties, antihemhorroid properties, and pain relieving properties.It is most frequently used by athletes, and the anecdotes of cissus seem to precede much of the science on the topic. It appears to be a very effective pain killer in rodent studies, but at this moment in time only one preliminary study has been conducted in humans; while it showed promise in athletes who experienced joint pain due to exercise (by reducing overall joint symptoms by about a third) it was still a lone study. More research is needed, but it seems promising as an alterative for joint pain in athletes since most joint health supplements do not have evidence in athletes (rather, most research is in osteoarthritis persons).Although a potential complication in athletes is that preliminary rodent evidence suggests that cissus has sedative and muscle relaxing properties at high doses (active within 30 minutes of ingestion), suggesting that it might not make the best pre-workout supplement.In regards to bone health, there are limited human reports of increased fracture healing rate which are poor quality of evidence due to not disclosing adequate methodology (ie. how they did the study) and not disclosing the source of the compound. Animal studies do show a great deal of promise in promoting bone growth, but this traditional claim also needs to be assessed in greater detail.Finally, there are two human studies which suggest that cissus can be used as a fat loss agent but they have problems with their structure. In particular both studies are confounded with possible financial biases and since the supplements were consumed before meals with water (and cissus is known to have gum forming properties) while food intake was not measured making it wholly possible the observed effects could be due to reduced food intake, which is what happens when a gum (glucomannan, for example) is taken before a meal with water.Overall, cissus has a good deal of promise in regards to joint and bone health in regards to athletic adults and menopausal women alike but requires a great deal more evidence to fully evaulate this promise."

These compounds include flavanols, procyanidins and (-)-epicatechin. Though these molecules are not unique to cocoa, cocoa extract contains a particularly high level of (-)-epicatechin, compared to other plant products.Supplementing cocoa extract or eating dark chocolate is linked to better blood flow and improved insulin sensitivity.Preliminary research suggests (-)-epicatechin may also provide benefits for longevity by increasing blood flow and oxygenation in the brain. Though this effect has not been linked to improved memory or cognitive performance, it may play a protective role during aging. Some evidence also suggests (-)-epicatechin can help mitigate the effects of impaired mitochondria.When (-)-epicatechin is absorbed by the body, it activates an insulin signaling pathway, which causes a mild increase in glucose uptake. Increased glucose uptake means the body is able to take in sugar from the blood more effectively. Supplementing (-)-epicatechin also increase the production ofnitric oxide, a molecule that widens blood vessels and improves blood flow.Eating about 26-40g of dark chocolate products containing at least 75% cocoa makes supplementing cocoa extract and (-)-epicatechin unnecessary. This is about 200 calories of dark chocolate, a bit less than a standard candy bar. Products low in cocoa, like milk chocolate and white chocolate, do not replace supplementation.

The effects of coconut oil on skin and hair after ingestion have not been studied.The majority of coconut oil (65%) is made up of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are triglycerides and fatty acids with a chain made of 6–10 carbon atoms. Studies suggest replacing calories with MCTs without exceeding daily caloric requirements can result in a small, but significant, increase in the rate of fat loss over time. This effect appears to be slightly more powerful in overweight people.Coconut oil may also temporarily increase metabolic rate and the speed at which fats are broken down to release fatty acids, a process known as lipolysis. This effect occurs when coconut oil is first added to the diet and disappears after two weeks. Coconut oil also creates more ketone bodies than longer chain fatty acids when it is broken down. One study has provided evidence that this mechanism is what causes coconut oil to provide obese people with a muscle preserving effect during caloric restriction. This effect has not been replicated in lean people.Adding coconut oil to a diet is unlikely to cause noticeable fat loss effects, but it can replace other dietary fatty acids in order to fine-tune a diet plan."

Newborns have immature digestive and immune systems, so the enzymes, antibodies, and growth factors colostrum provides promote growth and fight disease. Though colostrum is produced by all mammals, colostrum supplements are usually derived from bovine or (less frequently) goat sources. Colostrum has become a popular nutritional supplement because it is a rich source of enzymes, antibodies, and growth factors not found in other dairy products.The undeveloped intestinal tract of a newborn allows the growth factors present in colostrum to pass freely through the intestinal wall for absorption. However, fully-developed adult mammal intestines will break down the beneficial compounds before they can be absorbed into the blood stream. Though digestive enzymes prevent colostrum growth factors from affecting muscles, they will still exert a local effect, which increase intestinal integrity. This prevents inflammation, like the kind that can be caused by prolonged, intense exercise, like competitive cycling. Outside of intense exercise, supplementing colostrum will have an effect similar to supplementingwhey proteinor casein protein.Athletes often supplement colostrum in an effort to increase fat burning, add lean mass, or increase strength. Since their digestive systems are fully developed, these effects do not occur, and the body breaks down the growth factors and enzymes that colostrum provides before they can be transported to muscle cells.The antibodies present in colostrum are also effective at reducing diarrhea caused by Escherichia coli and reducing the risk of HIV infection.

The lower-LA group had a higher proportion of EPA in their platelet phosphatidylcholine, plasma phosphatidylcholine, and plasma phosphatidylethanolamine.[4]There’s also evidence that conversion of ALA to DHA is greater in women than men.[5][6]Women’s greater capacity for DHA synthesis may exist to satisfy the DHA needs of fetuses and neonates — particularly the needs of their developing brains.[7]EPA and DHA are involved in various biological processes, including brain function and several metabolic signaling pathways.[8]Since conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is inefficient (<8% of ALA becomes EPA, and <4% of ALA becomes DHA[3]), taking EPA and DHA directly is more effective at raising your levels of these two n−3 EFAs.EPA and DHA are present in the fat of fish and other seafoods, so eating those is an option.

eb050397-470d-4df8-8f23-845fabaca314,https://examine.com/supplements/folic-acid/,Folic Acid,Summary,"Folate is the essential vitamin sometimes referred to as Vitamin B9, but more commonly known by its synthetic supplemental form 'folic acid'. Found in low levels across most food products of plant origin and found in enhanced levels in some nation's wheat grain due to fortification, folic acid is a vitamin that has essential roles in the growth of neonates as well as in supporting a process known as methylation in adults.Folic acid is primarily known as being the 'pregnancy supplement' where women who are planning to conceive children take 400 μg folic acid daily. This is critical in preventing something known as 'neural tube defects' (NTDs) which are caused by insufficient folate provision to the fetus when their neural tube is being formed and the combination of food fortification and supplementation has greatly prevented.Beyond that, folate and folic acid are used to support methylation in the body. These two supplements, due to eventually forming a molecule known as5-methyltetrahydrofolate(5-MTHF or L-methylfolate) are involved in indirectly supporting and creatingS-Adenosyl Methionine(SAMe) in the body. Due to this, these supplements tend to show quite a bit of similarity to SAMe supplementation and some parallel to supplements involved in the alternate pathway which support SAMe levels (of which supplements likecreatineandtrimethylglycine(TMG) are implicated in). These parallels are best demonstrated in their effects on depression where they all seem to be implicated in supporting serotonin-based medication (SSRIs usually) as adjuvant with a trend to benefit women more than men.Despite these benefits, folic acid is unlike other B-vitamins where it does appear to have a potential side-effect when taken in high doses. While taking a very large dose of folic acid several thousand times the RDA will not cause immediate harm it appears that prolonged exposure to levels up to 250% the RDA may be associated with a relative increase in the rates of cancer, particularly colon cancer among the elderly; well demonstrated by acute increases in the rates of colon cancer when both Canada and the US introduced fortification (the rates, of which, have been declining beforehand and ever since). Among the B-vitamins, folate seems to be the one where a balance should be strived in your everyday life and high sources of supplemental folate should be avoided if not intended for other purposes.Finally, supplements tend to be in one of three forms; folate, folic acid, and L-methylfolate. Of these supplements folic acid is the most common but is thought to be negative when overconsumed. L-methylfolate seems the most promising as many people seem to have genetic mutations in the enzyme which produces L-methylfolatefromfolate and folic acid, so supplementing the latter two only causes a partial backlog in these people whereas supplementing L-methylfolate may circumvent this genetically disadvantageous rate-limiting step. Furthermore, L-methylfolate seems to be the most promising agent to support SAMe levels as SAMe, as a supplement, is quite expensive and this pathway tends to take on more of the workload than the one creatine and TMG are implicated in."

At least in rats, evidence of suppressed de novo lipogenesis has been noted and oral consumption of (-)-Hydroxycitric acid appears to reliably reduce food intake and body weight (the latter to a degree where food intake cannot explain all the observed effects)Studies in humans, for the most part, fail to replicate this; this may be related to less actual activity ofde novo lipogenesisin humans and a much higher level in rats.

The molecule is found in the food supply and in the human body where it acts as an antioxidant.
The 'glutathione system' comprises the enzymes that synthesize glutathione within a cell as well as dedicated enzymes that use glutathione as the means to exert antioxidant effects. Supplementation of glutathione is thought to support this pool of glutathione in a cell and thus maintain the efficacy of the entire glutathione system.
Despite the pervasive role of glutathione in cell biology, it currently has a limited role in nutritional supplementation due to the following pharmacokinetic properties:There may be some absorption of glutathione intact from the intestines, but it cannot enter cells intact. It must be metabolized to form L-cystine (two molecules of L-cysteine bound together) before being taken up.Provision of L-cysteine within the cell is all that is needed to increase glutathione synthesis, andN-Acetylcysteinedoes this efficiently at a lower financial cost than glutathione.In effect, glutathione is an indirect and expensive way to provide dietary L-cysteine. Dietary protein itself, including L-cysteine rich sources such asWhey Protein, are effective but inefficient ways to increase L-cysteine intake in the diet andN-Acetylcysteineis both more efficient and cheaper than glutathione.Although oral glutathione supplementation does not efficiently increase intracellular glutathione levels for the above reasons, it can be absorbed intact into the blood stream. Since increased glutathione levels in the blood have been shown to slow the breakdown of nitric oxide, glutathione supplementation may be useful to augment nitric oxide boosters such asL-CitrullineorL-Arginine."

People without CD or people with CD that also avoid gluten do not experience this increased risk.Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is another big topic for gluten researchers. There is some evidence to suggest people with non-celiac intestinal disorders like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are more likely to experience flatulence, pain, and nausea after consuming gluten than people with healthy intestinal tracts. However, people with NCGS do not experience the same level of damage after eating gluten than people with CD. So, the discomfort of people with NCGS may be better explained by other carbohydrates associated with gluten, rather than autoimmune damage. Researchers examining self-diagnosis of gluten sensitivity suggest that many people with NCGS do not actually display any sensitivity and the symptoms may be the result of discussions related to gluten causing intestinal problems, also known as a 'nocebo' effect.People with CD should avoid gluten at all costs, while people with other intestinal disorders may experience mild to severe discomfort after gluten consumption, possibly due to wheat's ability to produce gas.

It is most commonly known as a cognitive enhancing supplement that is somewhat 'interchangeable' withBacopa monnieri(insofar that the two share many of the same names) but has additional benefits for cardiovascular health (in particular, chronic venous insufficiency), skin regeneration rates and wound healing, and possible benefits to anxiety and rheumatism.In regards to its cognitive enhancing properties, it requires a few weeks to work and seems to cause an increase in neuronal growth (not how many neurons there are, but how far their dendrites branch out). This is due to activating a class of proteins known as MAPKs, which causes a release in a growth factor for neurons called Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). This is a mechanism somewhat similar toBacopa monnieriand the time-delay in improving cognition is also similar; however, currently there are no studies assessing whether they can be used alongside each other or which one is more potent.It has another independent mechanism where it augments the release of an anti-inflammatory signalling molecule from immune cells, in particular it enhances the secretion of the molecule known as IL-1β from the immune cells known as macrophages; it does this at a remarkably low concentration (in the picomolar range) and is likely relevant to oral supplementation, and if so this could partly explain benefits to chronic venous insuffiency (which are quite proven with human evidence) and its anti-rheumatic benefits (not as proven).Finally, this plant may inhibit a group of enzymes that break down collagen while simultanously increasing the rate that collagen is synthesized; this is thought to underlie the increase in wound healing rate (which is proven in animal research with preliminary human research) and is thought to be the reason whycentella asiaticais used as a skin tightening agent as any increase in collagen synthesis (like withcreatine) should cause a firmness of the skin."

It contains a variety of alkaloid structures, most notably the one named after it (Rhynchophylline) and a potent drug-like alkaloid with the acronym of GME (Geissoschizine methyl ether). It is a component of the popular japanese medicinal formula known as Yokukansan, where it alongsideglycyrrhiza uralensis(licorice) seem to mediate the neuroprotective effects.Studies that use oral ingestion of the herb or isolated alkaloids are only in the animal phases of research at this point in time, but it appears that GME has antipsychotic properties very similar to Aripiprazole (pharmaceutical) on the serotonin and dopamine receptors. The influence on the serotonin receptors also confers some anxiety reducing properties, and can reduce social aggression (thought to be the reason why Yokukansan reduces agitation in elderly persons with dementia).There is also a neuroprotective effect that is mostly based on preventing the brain's support cells (glial cells, which support the neurons) from activating in response to inflammation. This antiinflammatory effect in the brain appears to underlie anti-epileptic properties with oral ingestion of the herb.Beyond that, there is potential for this herb to reduce blood pressure secondary to activatingnitric oxidesignalling but this has not yet been investigated in living systems."

Grape juice is different enough from grapes, due to lack of fiber and consequent effects on gut bacteria and other factors, that the results of whole grape trials aren't transferable to grape juice.Wine contains alcohol (duh!), and alcohol in moderate amounts may help relax blood vessels and increase HDL.[2]Wine also has higher amounts of certain phytochemicals than grape juice does, but similar amounts of other ones.It doesn't appear that grape juice reduces blood sugar, insulin, blood pressure, or improved lipids. However, one study that used a highly concentrated juice was more likely to find benefits, so perhaps it's a dosing issue. There are a variety of studies, largely sponsored by a large juice company, that have explored other areas of health, and the results are so far inconclusive.It's important to note that there are very very few trials on grape juice, compared to on wine. So the reliability of the total body of evidence is somewhat low.How does grape juice compare to wine, for health DETRIMENTS?Grape juice doesn't contain alcohol. Consuming alcohol in moderate amounts can turn into consuming alcohol in large amounts, whether chronically or even on occasion.Even in moderate amounts over time, alcohol may not be that healthy. Some researchers believe the evidence for benefits is mixed enough, and potential detriment large enough, that health benefits should not be trumpeted.[3][4]Grape juice however, and fruit juices in general, are linked to tooth erosion and dental carries.[5]However, the trials on this typically use conditions that don't fully reflect real-life juice drinking. Grape juice in amounts that are clinically effective may also contribute excessive calories into your diet, as juices are much easier to consume than whole fruits.[6]What type of grape juice is used in clinical trials?Often but not always purple grape juice, at 100% purity (in other words, not mixed fruit juice, or sugar-added juice). Occasionally, white grape juice is used.How does grape juice compared to other fruit juices for health benefits?In general, sufficient trials haven't been conducted which compare different fruit juices against each other. There are a limited number of studies, such as one finding no difference between grape juice and apple juice[7]and one finding benefits of grape juice over orange or grapefruit juice[8]. But these were for highly specific outcomes rather than practical health benefits. Much more research is needed. We'd love to know how juices compare, but the financial incentive isn't there for companies to fund studies pitting juices against each other.All that being said, grape juice doesn't appear to help memory and cognition quite likeblueberryjuice can. Unfortunately for the consumer, blueberry juice is much more expensive than grape juice."

Some people also use the GAPS diet in an attempt to improve their gastrointestinal issues.The diet consists of an optional introduction phase — (broken into six stages, each adding specific foods that “heal the gut”) followed by the full GAPS diet for 18 to 24 months and then the subsequent reintroduction phase.Stage 1:Boiled meatCooked vegetablesFermented dairyHomemade meat stockFermented vegetable juiceWater or tea with raw honeyStage 2:Organic raw egg yolksFermented fishClarified butterStage 3:AvocadoFermented vegetablesCooked eggsSquashNutsStage 4:Meat that has been roasted or grilledCold-pressed olive oilHomemade carrot juiceStages 3 and 4 both include GAPS recipes for pancakes, bread, and a milkshake.

After the full GAPS diet, people can begin reintroducing potatoes, fermented grains, starchy vegetables, beans, and regular grains. The diet also recommends eating fermented food and bone broth at every meal, buying organic food, and avoiding processed foods. Fruit is to be avoided at meals on the diet, while proteins should always be eaten with vegetables; the diet claims these combinations normalize acidity levels in the body.Despite anecdotal reports of improvement on the diet, it has never been formally researched, and some of the theories — such asdietary treatments for autismand thedietary influence on blood acidity— have been either unsubstantiated or debunked. Alteredintestinal permeability(leaky gut) has not been consistently observed in children with ASD. Though the microbiomes of children with ASD differ from those of children without ASD, a causal relationship has not been established between the gut microbiome and ASD.[1]Importantly, these differences could be due to thesignificant differences in dietary patternsbetween children with ASD and others.Additionally, the introduction phase of the diet is restrictive, which could pose a risk to children with ASD and individuals with bowel diseases, as they are already at risk of malnutrition.[2]Despite the restrictions of the GAPS diet, it is not alow-FODMAP diet, so it may not be helpful for people with IBS, either."

Hesperitin is known to mediate the actions of hesperidin in the body, and since hesperidin needs to progress to the colon to be 'released' by intestinal bacteria it acts as a time-release for hesperitin; one serving of hesperidin seems to increase blood levels for over the course of a day or so when consumed in this manner.If we are to look at the human evidence on orally ingested hesperidin, it appears to promote blood flow (minorly to moderately) although it's unclear if it has a notable influence on blood pressure; the current research isn't supportive overall, though it hasn't been studied in severe hypertension yet. It is pretty much ineffective for cholesterol and triglycerides from the available evidence. Not much other human evidence exists aside from the cardiovascular parameters mentioned above, and it seems pretty weak at improving parameters of diabetes as well (with exception to the eyes, diabetic retinopathy, as preliminary evidence suggests that hesperidin is quite protective of them).That being said, in animal studies oral intake of hesperidin at a dose similar to that used in humans seems to be a very potent cardioprotection agent and is quite protective of the brain in response to various stressors; the protection is antioxidative in nature, but it seems to work through a currently not identified antioxidant responses from the genome. Aside from the protective effects (most notable in the heart and brain, but extend to every organ), hesperidin may be able to reduce a lack of appetite and have minor anti-allergic properties.Orange peels can actually be used to get the supplemental dosage of hesperidin seen in the human studies, and hesperidin is known to interact with a variety of drug metabolizing enzymes so it should be approached cautiously if also using pharmaceuticals."

It does not have significantly better absorptionoverall, but it is faster at peaking in the blood.Supplementation of hesperidin should be around 500mg and preferably taken with foodIn regards to food products, the lowest known beneficial dose of hesperidin in rodent studies is around 25mg/kg oral intake daily. This is approximately 4mg/kg oral intake for an adult human which may be a bit too high to consume via orange juice products (in optimal conditions, a 150lb man would need to consume 1,800mL) and orange fruits (1,800g of the fresh fruit). The exception to the above is the antiallergic effects, which have occurred at a fifth of the aforementioned dose.The peels of tangerines, however, appear to have 5-10% of their weight as hesperidin after 5-7 days of drying (to remove water content and concentrate the hesperidin) and as such a 500mg supplemental dose of hesperidin can be achieved by 5-10g of the dried tangerine peel. This is a low cost alternate assuming that the peel is thoroughly scrubbed prior to drying to remove possible contamination and grime collected on the peel.When looking at food products, it is unlikely that the benefits of hesperidin can be mediated by standard orange consumptionexcept maybefor antiallergic effects.

HMB promotes muscle protein synthesis by stimulatingmammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR), which regulates cell growth and differentiation.[13]HMB may also increase the activity of thegrowth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1(GH/IGF-1) axis.[14]HMB reduces protein degradation (protein breakdown) by inhibiting the activity of the body’s ubiquitin-proteasome system and caspases. These two pathways are responsible for breaking down proteins (proteolysis) under catabolic states such as fasting, immobilization, disuse, aging, and disease.[15][16][17]Inhibiting protein breakdown explains why HMB can minimize the loss of lean body mass in certain conditions."

This is due to table salt being iodized (added iodine) and even relative deficiencies being quite rare in first world countries (it is a common issue in developing countries due to iodine only naturally occurring from fish and seaweed which may not be consumed); actually benefitting from supplementation of iodine requires a 'perfect storm' of situations to occur which are outlined in the dosing section but not many people will meet these requirements.Supplementation of high doses of iodine in otherwise healthy people does not appear to result in much, since it is readily excreted and normalized. There may be a very small and (clinically) irrelevant antiinflammatory effect and a small reduction in thyroid hormones (rather than an increase), but that seems to be it.

In its main role in the body, iron is a critical component ofhemoglobin— the oxygen carrier of red blood cells — and a deficiency in iron leads to poor oxygen transport (anemia). In addition, iron acts as a cofactor for many enzymes. The iron found in plants (notably grains and legumes) is less bioavailable than the iron found in meat (in the form of heme). Iron is the double-edged sword of the nutrient world. On the one hand, many people have insufficient levels, but on the other hand, iron overload can be toxic to a wide variety of cells. Iron deficiency is the only reason to consider iron supplementation, though getting more iron through foods is preferable when possible. For people who already have enough iron, taking an iron supplement has no proven benefit, and on the contrary, it can lead toiron overdose.What are the benefits of iron?A lack of iron tends to producefatigue,depression, impaired cognitive function,restless leg syndrome, and other adverse effects. Correction of an iron deficiency tends to improve symptoms, and even among people who aren't anemic, more than the bare minimum amount of iron may be needed to produce the optimal amounts of hemoglobin and reap the benefits of greater oxygen delivery; however, the beneficial effect is probably limited to people whose iron levels are low according to conventional standards, though more research is needed. Iron supplements are also often used by athletes in an attempt to improve physical performance, however once again there does not appear to be any benefit when iron levels are not low. Iron deficiency is fairly common, and a great number of factors negatively affect iron status, so iron supplementation and iron-rich diets can be expected to benefit many people.What are the downsides of iron?Supplementation can produce nausea,headaches, and other symptoms.

Relative to the other two BCAAs, isoleucine is intermediate for its ability to induce muscle protein synthesis (stronger than valine, but much weaker than leucine) but is able to significantly increase glucose uptake and the usage of glucose during exercise. Isoleucine does not promote glycogen synthesis, however.Via a PI3K/aPKC dependent mechanism (which is notable since this is neither mediated by the more common AMPK mechanism seen with supplements likeberberinenor muscle contraction-mediated uptake) isoleucine can increase glucose uptake into a muscle cell. Leucine also appears to have this ability, but due to leucine stimulating a protein known as S6K (required for protein synthesis) leucine reduces its own efficacy by hindering insulin-stimulated uptake. In other words, while isoleucine and leucine both stimulate glucose uptake leucine then shoots itself in the foot and hinders itself while isoleucine just acts in a predictable and linear manner.Although extensive human testing has not been conducted yet, isoleucine can be seen as the BCAA which mediates glucose uptake (into a cell) and breakdown (into energy) to a larger degree than other amino acids and may serve a role as a hypoglycemic (in diabetics) or as a performance enhancer (if taken preworkout in a carbohydrate replete state)."

Surprisingly,Gynostemmahas a good content of Ginsenosides that were once thought to be wholly unique toPanax Ginseng. As such, the biological effects ofGynostemmaandPanaxseem to be quite similar exceptGynostemmamay be more anti-diabetic (due to the unique Gypenosides inGynostemma, that are not inPanax).There are limited human studies at the moment, as most studies are attempting to delineate the large amount of Gypenosides in this herb to see which ones can be seen as the 'active' compounds. Currently, we have two human studies suggesting that a tea made fromGynostemmacan be used alongside standard anti-diabetic therapy and augment the efficacy of it over time (known as adjunct therapy).Most of its 'beneficial' effects beyond the diabetic effects (which are mediated by a possible mix of AMPK activation and PTP1B inhibition; the amount each contributes to the overall effects unknown) come from inducing antioxidant enzymes and protecting cells from oxidative damage over time. There seems to be a motif where preloading and chronic loading is very protective at low doses, and acute supplementation or rehabilitation (taking the supplement after the stressor) appears to be less effective. As such, the health effects of Gynostemma Pentaphyllum appear to be more prophylactic rather than rehabilitative or therapeutic.This herb is also touted for youthfulness and longevity, but neither claim has been explored. Additionally, the anti-cancer effects are still in beginning stages of research but the effects appear to be very similar in many cell lines; some compound in the Gypenoside fragment may be an inducer of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, as the downstream events associated with p53 activity have been noted repeatedly (although direct kinetics between Gypenosides and p53 have not yet been investigated; this is a likely theory but not established)Overall, this is a more anti-diabeticPanax Ginseng; the downside is that the other benefits associated withPanax Ginseng(adaptogenic, cognitive enhancing, anti-fatigue) have not yet been assessed properly withGynostemma Pentaphyllum."

7e02d072-cff2-4aea-bc51-3054bac46f4b,https://examine.com/diets/keto/,Ketogenic Diet,Summary,"What is keto, and how is it different from ""low carb""?Keto is a fairly simple concept to understand:Research studies generally peg under 50 grams as ketogenic, and 50-150 as ""low-carbohydrate"".[1][2]When most people eat less than around 50 grams a day of carbohydrate, they soon start producing high levels of something called ""ketone bodies"". These are simply breakdown products of fat, and are used to fuel cells that normally depend on glucose.Why might keto help improve your health?Keto's impact on health isn't so simple.Your brain and nervous system usually run on glucose. Fueling it mostly with ketones is a whole new world to these cells, and may provide benefit. The main condition this has been studied for is epilepsy, but more research on other conditions is underway.Keto's impact OUTSIDE of that, though, is more complicated. Keto is purported to aid with weight loss more so than other weight loss diets. The evidence for this is mixed, but tends to show fairly similar weight loss as other diets, according a meta-analysis of 32 trials comparing carb levels.[3]Keto benefits for a variety of conditions may stem from restriction of carbohydrate,[4]avoidance of typical carb-containing processed junk foods (so not the carb itself, but the food that contains it),[5][6]and/or benefits from the ketone bodies themselves.[7][8][9]Is keto safe? Are there any detriments?There are three different purported reasons that keto might not be totally safe:First is the claim that high levels of ketones can be dangerous. This is generally not true with ketogenic diets, as ketoacidosis (dangerously high ketone levels typically caused by diabetes) doesn't seem to occur absent an uncontrolled medical condition, with no cases being reported in a two-year ketogenic diet study.[10]However, possibly the first case of ketoacidosis in a nondiabetic patient was reported in 2015, in a lactating woman on a ketogenic diet.[11]. A later case study purported to be the first of a healthy, nondiabetic, and non-lactating woman experiencing ketoacidosis.[12]Ketone bodies are acidic by their very nature, although blood pH is typically well-regulated by our kidneys and lungs. While there may be a theoretical detriment to mild acidosis,[13]trials haven't shown adverse effects of sustained production of ketone bodies over time.Second is the idea that going too long without getting ""enough"" carbohydrate is inherently dangerous. This is also generally not true, as carbohydrate isn't an essential nutrient (you can make all you need to survive, by a process called gluconeogenesis, without ingesting any through food or drink).[14]There isn't any trial evidence though on what the long term effects (e.g. 5-10 or more years) of carbohydrate deprivation are, and whether ketogenic diets have any negative impact on unstudied health conditions, certain genotypes, etc.Finally, there are claims of harm from diets high in animal products, and most keto diets happen to be high in animal products. This claim is nearly impossible to evaluate with a simple yay or nay, given the huge number of studies involved with varying conclusions. What we know is that evidence is mixed, and slightly differs depending on the animal product in question (for example, fish consumption often shows a slight benefit for longevity in observational studies)[15][16]. Multi-decade randomized trials aren't feasible for foods, so we have to rely on imperfect evidence. In prospective (non-trial) studies, processed red meat often has a strong correlation with increased all-cause mortality and diseases, whereas unprocessed red meat often has a much smaller or no correlation.[17][18][19]Egg consumption typically shows negligible or no detriment to all-cause mortality and disease,[20][21]although again, evidence is mixed, with some other reviews finding a correlation of high egg intakes to disease.[22]Meta-analytic results can differ depending on timeframe (intermediate versus longer term outcomes), which studies are excluded and included, and a variety of other factors. Some studies are funded by financially-interested parties (for example, the beef and egg industries), raising the possibility of publication bias or other biases. But other non-industry funded studies also tend to back up a detriment primarily from processed meats, and less or negligible detriment from unprocessed meats, depending on the amount eaten. This will remain an open question, given the difficulty in conducting long term randomized diet trials."

There are some unique properties of these berries though, and they seem to be related to calcium metabolism. Specifically, the berries reduce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cells when it would otherwise be stimulated (in a manner that candrop belowbaseline levels if high enough in concentration) and due to this the contraction seen in vessels including the penis that would normally occur from calcium release is attenuated.A rat study has noted abnormally high increases in testosterone (700%) but such an increase has failed in the pilot study on healthy men.

It contains a 'bitter principle' which is a mixture of two molecules, the irioid glycosides known as picroside I and picroside II (picroside II also being called kutkoside) and the mixture overall is then called kutkin or picroliv. Overall, these are the active components.The herb itself, due solely to the kutkin molecules, appears to be potently hepatoprotective (protective of the liver) when ingested prior to or taken after exposure to a toxin. The protective effects seem to extend to all tested toxins or stressors that are known to alter liver function, and appear to also extend to states of intrinsic liver dysfunction (viral hepatitis and NAFLD from a high fat diet). Most notably it is protective against Tylenol,alcohol, and the deathcap mushroom with a potency that is greater than silymarins (the active parts ofmilk thistlesupplementation).This fairly remarkable hepatoprotection frompicrorhiza kurroais limited by its lack of human studies, as despite the multitude of animal research on the topic there appears to only be one study in humans which showed that a very low dose of the supplement (25mg kutkin) was effective against viral hepatitis. Future studies in humans are needed to confirm its protective effects, and currentlypicrorhiza kurroais a remarkably promising herb."

Out of all the amino acids, leucine is the most potent activator of protein synthesis. Cells are able to sense leucine levels, and in response turn on protein synthesis via the enzyme protein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master-regulator of protein synthesis.Given the well-established protein-synthesis activating properties of leucine, a number of human trials have been conducted to determine whether adding supplemental leucine to various protein sources can augment muscle protein synthesis (MPS), particularly in older adults.Anabolic resistance is a well-established phenomenon during aging, with cells becoming more resistant to turning on protein synthesis. This can be partly ameliorated with extra leucine, as research indicates that older adults need twice as much leucine compared to younger adults for similar activation of MPS.[1]This increased leucine requirement for MPS in older adults can be partially explained by increased retention of orally ingested leucine in the gut, which is retained twice as much compared to young adults,[2]limiting the amount of leucine that makes it into the blood stream. Resistance to leucine-stimulated protein synthesis also occurs at the cellular level in aging cells.Results in both younger and older adults have shown that supplementation with leucine enhances the MPS response,[3][4][5][6]namely when a suboptimal dose of protein is consumed.In a study that compared a low (6 g) dose of whey protein alongside 3 or 5 g of extra leucine to 25 g of whey protein alone in younger adults, the low dose of whey protein plus 5 g of leucine meal stimulated MPS to a similar, but lesser extent than 25 g of whey protein.[3]Another study in younger adults compared the same 25 g dose of whey protein to 6 g of whey protein with an amount of leucine equivalent to 25 g of whey protein and found that only the group that consumed 25 g of whey protein had elevated MPS 3 to 5 hours post-exercise.[4]Despite the positive effects of leucine on acute rates of MPS, long-term supplementation has largely failed to augment increases in muscle mass and strength in older adults.[7]Further research is needed to determine whether supplementation with leucine can augment muscle mass accretion in older adults with suboptimal protein intake.Research suggests that supplemental leucine can augment muscle protein synthesis when a suboptimal dose of protein is consumed, but supplemental leucine will not confer additional benefit if a protein bolus sufficient to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis is consumed."

Licorice is also routinely used as a candy product, and is inherently a functional food rather than just a candy (as the oil containing the traditional licorice flavor also contains some bioactive compounds).One of the most important compounds in Licorice appears to be Glycyrrhizin, which is the sugar-bound form of Glycyrrhetic Acid (there exists both an alpha and beta isomer, with the latter 18β-Hydroxyglycyrrhetic acid being referred to frequently). This compound is highly relevant when consuming pure licorice extracts due to its good absorption and relatively high content, but also underlies a fairly reliable reduction intestosteroneand a highly reliable increase in circulating cortisol after consumption. Both of these effects are dose-dependent and not associated with any toxicological effects (and reversed upon cessation of Licorice), but many persons may want to avoid Glycyrrhizin and Glycyrrhetic Acid due to these reasons.An ethanolic extract of Licorice, sometimes used in supplements, is able to concentrate flavanoids and isoflavanoid compounds with a relatively low Glycyrrhizin content.

It is a great source of ellagic and gallic acids, which are potent anti-oxidants; these compounds are not inherently linked to improvements in cognition nor are the Procyanidins or catechins found in Longan. There actually does not appear to be a large amount of compounds known to be unique to Longan fruits, which may be discovered in the future. No bioactive is linked to the cognitive protective or memory enhancing properties.Beyond that, the polysaccharides appear to be able to interact with the immune system and can act in an immunostimulatory manner. At least one study suggests that the potency is comparable to Ganoderic Acid (fromReishi) but this needs to be replicated; it is another promising avenue.Other interactions of Longan such as interactions with fat mass, skin quality, or the colorectal cancer interactions are currently unremarkable. There is not enough evidence to suggest Longan fruit as a recommended option for anything although it might be a useful functional food to ingest for cognitive purposes."

It seems to have a wider variety of triterpenoids rather than a high level of any one triterpenoid, and this class of molecules seems to underlie most of the benefits associated with the leaf extracts. There is not a good idea of what molecules are in the seeds, and it is though that they are also a source of triterpenoids since no unique molecules are known in them.The benefits of this plant right now tend to be associated with either high or undisclosed doses of the seeds, suggesting that they probably don't apply to oral ingestion of standard doses in humans. The only roles where supplementation may be useful are in control of diabetes and possibly in reducing ulcer formation, but both of these claims can be achieved if not easily outperformed by using isolated ursolic acid or other supplements.

Magnesium acts as an electrolyte and is a cofactor for more than 300 enzymes. Magnesium is required for energy (ATP) production, glucose metabolism, DNA and protein synthesis, nerve conduction,bone health, and cardiovascular regulation, among other functions. It also plays a crucial role in the synthesis and activation ofvitamin D.Dietary sources of magnesium include dark green leafy vegetables, nuts and seeds, legumes, whole grains, and meat/fish such as salmon, chicken, and beef.[1]Many foods such as breakfast cereals and bread are fortified with magnesium. It appears that approximately 20%–40% of the dietary magnesium that enters the body becomes bioavailable.[227][228][229]More than half of adults may not meet the recommended daily intake of magnesium,[1]likely because Western diets tend to be very low in magnesium-rich foods and high in processed foods and refined grains, which are magnesium-poor. As such, magnesium deficiency — which elevates the risk ofobesity, diabetes,cardiovascular disease,metabolic syndrome, andosteoporosis— is a major public health concern, especially for older adults.[230][231]"

Excess magnesium in the body is eliminated by the kidneys, so the risk of magnesium toxicity from food is quite low for healthy people.[258]Supplementing with high doses and certain magnesium salts (i.e., magnesium carbonate, magnesium chloride, magnesium gluconate, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium oxide) can have a laxative effect — though some people choose to take certain forms of magnesium for this reason.[183][1]Unabsorbed magnesium salts have an osmotic effect in the intestinal tract and can increase gastric motility. In one study, 12% of participants experienced diarrhea with a 1,000 mg dose of magnesium oxide,[259]but this form of magnesium is poorly absorbed, and the dose is well above the tolerableupper limit(UL) for magnesium of 350 mg for healthy adults.[260]Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping are also occasional side effects reported from supplemental magnesium.Magnesium supplements can also interfere with the absorption of certain medications, including bisphosphonates (used for treating osteoporosis) and antibiotics — to avoid these interactions, individuals who are taking these types of medications should talk to their healthcare provider about how to space out and time their supplemental magnesium.[1]"

In other words, it may not be the case that supplemental magnesium is beneficialper se; instead, magnesium deficiency may lead to several health problems, many of which may be related to chronic low-gradeinflammation.[261]There is also the possibility of reverse causation because many modern diseases (i.e.,obesityand diabetes) may lead to a magnesium deficiency.Nonetheless, there are well-documented mechanisms that explain why magnesium may benefit health.For one, magnesium plays a role in beta-cell activity in the pancreas, influencing insulin secretion and, therefore, our ability to regulateblood glucose. Magnesium deficiency can lead to impaired insulin secretion, impaired glucose utilization, and insulin resistance — all of which contribute to the development oftype 2 diabetes.[262]In the cardiovascular system, magnesium regulatescalciumconcentrations, which enhances vascular relaxation and inhibits vasoconstriction, leading to healthy vascular tone and protecting against high blood pressure (hypertension). Magnesium also improvesendothelial functionby directly stimulating the release ofnitric oxide(NO).[263]In the brain, magnesium binds to and blocks the actions of NMDA receptors, thereby preventing glutamate-dependent transmission of cortical spreading depression — one mechanism involved in the pathogenesis ofmigraine headache. Magnesium is also aGABAagonist. Magnesium affects the function of serotonin receptors, influences platelet aggregation, and regulates the synthesis and release of several neurotransmitters. These mechanisms explain magnesium’s benefit for migraine, as well as the potential for magnesium to improve sleep and other aspects of neurological health.[264][265]"

Theupper intake level(UL) for magnesium for adults is 350 mg; this valueonlyincludes magnesium obtained from dietary supplements and medications.Which forms of magnesium are best for people who are looking to increase their magnesium levels for general purposes or to correct a deficiency? Magnesium citrate appears to have the highest bioavailability of all forms of magnesium[217], followed by magnesium lactate. Magnesium chloride, magnesium gluconate, and magnesium glycinate also appear to have good bioavailability.[183]On the other hand, magnesium oxide and magnesium carbonate have extremely poor absorption and aren’t recommended for the purpose of increasing magnesium levels in the body.Magnesium citrate — especially potassium magnesium citrate — and magnesium lactate also appear to carry a lower risk for gastrointestinal side effects and diarrhea compared to other formulations.[183]More frequent reporting of side effects seems to be related to supplementing with magnesium carbonate and magnesium oxide, though gastrointestinal-related issues can occur with any type of magnesium supplement if too high of a dose is taken.Although magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) is often used in bath preparations to soothe achy and sore muscles, there’s a lack of evidence to support the transdermal (through the skin) absorption of magnesium.[218]A warm soak might be relaxing, but it’s not due to the magnesium."

The human body requires very low quantities of molybdenum to support three groups of enzymes.Molybdenum deficiencies are extremely rare, since molybdenum is easily available through the diet, as it is found in grains and water. The body easily retains molybdenum, and only needs a few micrograms.Molybdenum functions as a cofactor for three groups of enzymes, meaning it is needed for the enzymes to do their job. It is incorporated into a molecule called molybdopterin, which forms the actual cofactor. A molybdenum deficiency would impair the functions of these enzymes, which would prevent the body from processing amino acids that contain sulfur. Molybdenum deficiencies are characterized by symptoms similar to sulfur toxicity.Molybdenum supplementation is unnecessary. Due to the lack of evidence and very low risk of deficiency, molybdenum may not even need to be added to multivitamin formulas."

While it is indeed nutritious, supplemental dosages are too low to acquire adequate nutrition from and this claim is not relevant; it is a relatively potent antioxidant, and while it seems to be less potent than other herbs when tested outside of a living system it does appear to be quite potent when tested in living models. The reason for the increased potency in living models is not known (although it is possible that it can induce cellular transcriptional changes similar tosulforaphanesince the bioactives are similar in structure), but the antioxidant properties seem to underlie the vast majority of benefits associated with this supplement.There are also antiinflammatory effects that, while less studied, seem to be quite effective. One of the bioactives, RBITC, is effective in suppressing macrophage activation in the nanomolar range and is worth some future research into. Beyond that, there does appear to be a nice anti-diabetic effect that has undergone preliminary human testing. This work suggested that this moringa oleifera may promote pancreatic health and reduce blood glucose secondary to this.While both the antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties are somewhat interesting, until the exact mechanisms and relative potency to some other antioxidants or antiinflammatories are tested it is hard to recommend this supplement over other options.It is important to note that although the plant is generally considered to be 'nontoxic', this does not appear to be the case at all times. While supplemental dosages listed below appear to be safe from all tested toxicity a, relatively small increase (3-4 times the recommended does) is known to cause genotoxic damage and may promote cancer formation whereas higher doses cause overt organ damage (mostly liver and kidneys). This effect is seen with the seeds while toxicity of the leaves seems to be a lesser concern.

09a53686-ab97-485c-a31d-3464a45bf9e3,https://examine.com/supplements/nattokinase/,Nattokinase,Summary,"Nattokinase is one of many enzymes isolated from the fermented food product known as Nattō (boiled soybeans fermented specifically with the bacteriaBacillus subtilis) and was initially though to be a kinase, hence its name. It is a serine protease of the subtilisin class for its technical designation, and is used as a health supplement due to its 'fibrinolytic' properties (being able to enzymatically degrade fibrin, which is thought to reduce cardiovascular incidents by preventing thrombus formation and subsequent blood clotting).The enzyme appears to be active following ingestion, although it is not known whether it is directly active.In vitroexperiments (experiments performed outside a living body) suggest that nattokinase directly digests fibrin, and a few interventions do note that oral ingestion of nattokinase results in decreased thrombus formation. Nattokinase can be metabolized into bioactive peptides that also induce a factor (tissue plasminogen activator) which can subsequently also have fibrinolytic effects, so although the overall effect (fibrinolysis causing less clotting potential) appears to exist the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated.The breakdown products of nattokinase, following heat or acid destruction, are bioactive peptides that may also reduce blood pressure via reducing renin activity and angiotension II. With respect to effect on triglycerides and cholesterol, nattokinase and its bioactive peptides all appear to be wholly inactive.When looking at human intervention research, there appears to be a minor blood pressure reducing effect associated with nattokinase supplementation. Although there is limited evidence to support the fibrinolytic effects in humans following oral consumption, the trials using nattokinase in isolation are either limited in statistical power or they used nattokinase with other agents (the most convincing study currently usedpycnogenolalongside nattokinase).Overall, although the enzymatic activity and pharmacodynamics of nattokinase are novel, there is not enough evidence to support the usage of nattokinase over other supplemental or pharmacological options. Especially in regard to using an agent as prophylactic, aspirin is much more well researched and no comparative evidence exists right now comparing nattokinase to said reference drug.The heart health benefits attributed to Nattō are confounded both with the inclusion of other enzymes from bacteria, as well as a highVitamin Kcontent inherent to Nattō."

Both nefiracetam and aniracetam are fat soluble racetam drugs for the purpose of memory enhancement or the treatment of cognitive decline.In regards to acute usage, a single dosage of nefiracetam does not appear to significantly affect memory formation. Nefiracetam appears to be able to increase memory formation when taken daily over a prolonged period of time (7 days or longer), which has been repeatedly shown in animal studies with some limited human evidence suggesting the same. Prolonged supplementation is also associated with a higher rate of neurogenesis, which is not seen acutely.The mechanisms of nefiracetam seem to be linked back to two pathways. One of these pathways is prolonging the opening of calcium channels (tied into PKA and a Gi/oprotein) which enhances signalling of a receptor independent of the synapse, and the other pathway seems to be tied into PKC and CAMKII which then augments signalling through cholinergic receptors (which then releases most excitatory neurotransmitters from the presynaptic level in a manner similar tonicotine).The former pathway (calcium channels) appears to be critical for long-term potentiation, whereas the latter pathway (PKC/CAMKII) appears to be vital for neuronal signal enhancement.Some other minor pathways include being a partial agonist at theglycinebinding site of the NDMA receptor (may enhance signalling when there are subpar levels of glycine, but attenuates excessive signalling) and increasing affinity of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors for its ligand, acetylcholine.Nefiracetam is a cogntive enhancer that appears to promote memory formation, and it does so via enhancing signalling of acetylcholine and glutamate at the synapse and then prolonging the calcium in the activated neuron. It does not appear to work acutely, but requires daily supplementationIn regards to the potential toxicity of nefiracetam, it does appear to be reliably toxic in dogs at doses that are much higher than the recommended supplemental dosage; lower doses seem to be free from toxicity, and these lower dosesbarelyfit into the recommended dosage range.That being said, there is evidence to suggest that this toxicity is exclusive to canines as it has not been detected in rats nor monkeys. There is insufficient human testing to absolutely confirm that it isn't a concern for humans, but the limited human evidence at this point in time using the recommended nefiracetam dosages do not find any significant complications.Nefiracetam is highly toxic to dogs, but this does not appear to extend to monkeys nor rodents.

7ecb9414-1066-4d68-96d8-a31fc5fa3194,https://examine.com/supplements/nicotine/,Nicotine,Summary,"Nicotine is one of the many, albeit most famous, alkaloid in cigarettes that naturally occurs in tobacco. Nicotine itself exists in many other plants (those of theSolanaceaefamily such as eggplant or peppers) but at miniscule doses. When nicotine is isolated from tobacco containing products or cigarettes, it has a significantly different profile of effects in the body and for all intents and purposes should be seen as a different intervention.Nicotine has a few mechanisms at its roots. The first is that nicotine mimics the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and can directly activate acetylcholine receptors (which can then induce increases of catecholamines such as adrenaline and dopamine; this mechanism underlies both potential addiction and fat burning). Nicotine may also act as an anti-estrogenic compound, inhibiting aromatase and one of the two estrogen receptors directly; this may underlie some of the side-effects associated with chronic usage of nicotine, particularly in women. Finally, nicotine is pro-oxidative in nature but at a level which may be hormetic in nature, that works with the acetylcholine mechanism just mentioned to exert anti-inflammatory effects.Nicotine appears to have a role as a fat burner due to its mechanisms, which for the most part increase adrenaline and then work through beta-adrenergic receptors (the molecular target ofephedrine); this increase in adrenaline mediates the increase in metabolic rate which is significant but short-lived with moderate usage. The increase in lipolysis (how available fatty acids are to be burnt) appears to be mediated by other, possibly pro-oxidative, mechanisms and not by adrenaline.This increase in catecholamines also underlies many benefits of nicotine oncognition(attention and focus mainly) while the acetylcholine mimicking may promote a nootropic effect inherently.In regards to addiction, the risk of nicotine and addiction is a measurement between how much nicotine is taken (with more nicotine being associated with greater risk) and the speed of nicotine reaching the brain (with faster spikes in neural concentration being associated with both greater perceived benefits and greater risk of addiction). Gums and patches have less potential risk for addiction than do cigarettes (with inhalers in the middle) due to speed nicotine reaches the brain.Acutely, potential side-effects of nicotine are similar to acute side-effects of other stimulants such asephedrine,yohimbine, orcaffeinedue to increasing catecholamines. Over the long term, the side-effect profile of nicotine may rival ephedrine as those two retain a degree of catecholamine secretion over time (the other two losing efficacy in 2 weeks or less)."

This includes buying 2mg gums or cutting a 24mg nicotine patch into quarters to start, then work up to what is seen as the minimum effective dose. There is currently no established 'threshold' for when risk becomes too great as it varies between individuals.If using nicotine as Nicotine Replacment Therapy (to curb smoking cravings), then following the instructions on the product is sufficient.

It appears to be a potent regulator of blood flow and vasodilatation via its metabolitenitric oxide, and has greater relative affinity for areas of the body with poor oxygenation as the conversion of nitrite (NO2-, a metabolite of nitrate) to nitric oxide is undergone by deoxygenated blood.In regards to cardiovascular health, it appears to reduce blood pressure in instances where blood pressure is raised. This appears to occur in people with hypertension and can occur in otherwise healthy persons undergoing exercise with little effect on resting blood pressure in healthy persons. It may exert endothelial protective effects, and is thought to be a link between vegetable intake and cardiovascular health.It appears to enhance exercise performance secondary to reducing the oxygen cost of exercise (and thus prolonging time to exhaustion, thought to be due to increased mitochondrial efficiency). There is little to no effect on acute power output, but seems to reduce the rate of fatigue seen with continued muscle contractions and as such seems to have most benefit in exercises ranging from 1 minutes up to 10 minutes and as such exerts most benefit during anaerobic cardiovascular exercise or muscular endurance events (sports requiring anaerobic intervals such as hockey or rugby, some benefit to rowing and crossfit-type exercises) but although it does have benefit to prolonged cardiovascular exercise (5km jogs or 10km cycling events) the magnitude of effect appears to be lesser.Due to interactions with nitric oxide, it appears to also be kidney protective and may help to regulate blood flow during the aging process (which is associated with reduced nitrate levels in circulation); the anti-aging effects, however, are preliminary at this moment in time. Due to endogenous production of nitrate and some disease states with lower circulating nitrate (cardiovascular diseases and aging) nitrate may have pseudovitamin-like properties but more evidence is required to support this claim.Nitrate has the potential to form carcinogenic nitrosamines, although the practical significance of this in living systems is not known (epidemiological survey research has failed to show a significant link after controlling for other confounds, but some nitrosamines themselves are proven carcinogenic; practical relevance of nitrates and subsequently forming nitrosamines following supplemental or vegetable intake in a mixed diet is not really known).

Research on rats shows that both injections and oral intake of OEA causes a reliable reduction in the amount of food eaten.Limited human evidence suggests that OEA may be able to aid fat loss by acting on PPARα. When this receptor is activated in fat tissue, energy expenditure increases. Further evidence is needed before oral supplementation of OEA can be recommended for weight loss."

This is attributed to the effects of hydroxytyrosol, and appears to be active at a low enough dose to apply to olive product (e.g., extra virgin olive oil) consumption. Olive leaf may also influence levels of blood lipids in a beneficial manner (lowerLDL-C, lowertriglycerides, higherHDL-C) although these changes are rather small and inconsistent. Olive leaf extract shows some promise in loweringblood pressurein people with high blood pressure.Olive leaf extract may have beneficial effects onglycemic control, although research is limited. The mechanisms of olive leaf on glucose metabolism could be related to effects on pancreatic function and/or inhibition of carbohydrate (e.g., sucrose) metabolism in the intestines.Although olive leaf has been implicated in fat burning through various mechanisms (increased thyroid hormones and adrenaline have been shown in animal studies), clinical trials have failed to show a fat burning effect with olive leaf supplement use. The reason for this is not known, but may be related to a decrease in levels of the receptor that adrenaline works through which may attenuate the effects."

For daily fasting of set durations, the term “time-restricted eating” is preferred. For the sake of this page, the terms will be used interchangeably.Time-restricted eating is often described as the ratio of hours spent abstaining from food and the hours where eating is permitted.In the 18:6, 20:4, and one-meal-a-day (OMAD) protocols, individuals abstain from any caloric intake for 18 to 23 hours a day and then eat freely for the rest of the day. Those who follow the OMAD protocol eat all their food at one sitting, which typically lasts an hour or less, while the other protocols typically involve more than one meal or a meal and a snack.Colloquially, these types of eating schedules fall under the category of “intermittent fasting”, but in the scientific literature that term generally refers to eating schedules that involve abstaining from or drastically lowering energy intake for more than 24 hours. Time-restricted eating can involve a caloric deficit[1]to lose weight, but doesn’t have to.[2]The 18:6, 20:4, and one-meal-a-day (OMAD) protocols are types of time-restricted eating where you abstain from eating for 18 to 23 hours, and then eat freely for the rest of the day.

That being said, the more restrictive protocols can present a considerable challenge to some. When paired with resistance exercise, there doesn’t seem to be strength or muscle losses, but further research is required.[3]Most of the purported benefits of fasting come from the shift into an energy-scarce state, which upregulates metabolic pathways associated with cell-cycle regulation and energy mobilization.[4]Shorter fasts probably don’t provoke these changes, but fasting for 18 hours or more might. Although there isn’t a lot of data on extended fasts, one 24-hour fasting study saw considerable improvements in blood pressure and glycemic control.[5]For some people, these protocols may be easier to follow than standard weight loss diets. Additionally, they may lead to cardiometabolic benefits."

Many choose their fasting window to begin around 8 p.m. and extend to dinnertime the next day, but it’s just as possible to eat earlier in the day and stop eating earlier.Studies using 16:8 fasting protocols have found that insulin sensitivity (and thus overall glycemic response to food) tends to be better in the morning, so having an early eating window may be preferable for some people, although many opt to eat later in the day because it’s more conducive with social eating.[9][10][11][12]Adherence to these protocols is typically easier for people who have familial support, and for some the practice becomes easier with time.[13][6][8]Generally speaking, water, tea, seltzer, and coffee are considered permissible to eat during the fasting window. While other things such as chewing gum, exogenous ketones, MCT oil, supplements, apple cider vinegar, and artificial sweeteners are hotly debated, a good rule of thumb is that if the product has more than 5-10 kcal then it should be avoided until the fasting window ends.It’s simple: don’t consume anything except for water, coffee, or tea for 18 to 23 continuous hours, and then eat freely for the rest of the day."

2238a229-466e-4b1f-b77b-5c650697a1f5,https://examine.com/supplements/ornithine/,Ornithine,Summary,"L-Ornithine is a nonprotein amino acid (not used to create proteins) that is an intermediate of the urea cycle, and provision of ornithine to a cell is actually the rate limiting step of the cycle. Ornithine binds with a molecule known as carbamoyl phosphate which requires ammonia to be produced and then is converted intoL-Citrullinegiving off urea as a byproduct. Due to this, the conversion is one that reduces ammonia concentrations in the blood and concomitantly increases urea.L-Ornithine is thought to be important for conditions that are characterized by an excess level of ammonia, and this is mainly focused on either hepatic encephalopathy (clinical liver condition) or prolonged cardiovascular exercise. A reduction in serum ammonia has been repeatedly found in persons with hepatic encephalopathy (most studies use infusions, although it appears to apply to high dose oral supplements as well) while there are only two studies assessing exercise; the one that was better suited to assess the influence of ammonia (using prolonged exercise rather than acute exercise) did find an anti-fatigue effect.Furthermore, reductions in self-reported fatigue have been noted in persons with hepatic encephalopathy and in persons subject to a hangover (the process of getting drunk off ofalcoholwill increase serum ammonia) when ornithine is taken before drinking, but only in persons sensitive to alcohol perhaps.There is currently one study using ornithine paired with arginine that noted improvements in lean mass and power output in weightlifters, but this is an old study that has not been replicated and its practical relevance is uncertain.Finally, the increases in growth hormone seen with ornithine are similar to those seen with arginine. Technically they exist, but as they are very short lived and the body seems to compensate the overall increaes in whole-day growth hormone are not significant. Since the main properties of growth hormone being concerned with (increased lean mass gain and fat loss) are more related to day-long exposure rather than short-bursts, it is unlikely that ornithine has a role here.In the end, ornithine looks somewhat promising for reducing ammonia concentrations in the blood and thus enhancing performance of prolonged exercise (45 minutes or more) which is in part due to it being elevated in the blood for a few hours after ingestion despite exercise."

Like all other racetams, it is a synthetic molecule that is not found in food sources or in nature.When looking at the evidence for oxiracetam at this point in time it seems to have a fair bit of human evidence for reducing the rate of organic cognitive decline (a natural loss in cognition that occurs during the aging process that is not associated with any disease state) and with dementia, yet the lone study in persons with Alzheimer's showed no apparent benefit with oxiracetam supplementation. When it does aid in cognitive decline, it is somewhat comparable in potency toAlpha-GPCand seems to be slightly more potent than piracetam.There is currently no evidence to support cognitive enhancement of oxiracetamin young humanswith no cognitive impairment looking to increase memory formation.When looking at animal evidence, oxiracetam appears to very reliably and potently prevent amnesia induced by a variety of anti-cholinergic or anti-glutaminergic compounds (injections of 3-30mg/kg in rats pretty much normalizing memory formation). It has been implicated in increasing memory formation in otherwise healthy and young rats/mice with no apparent cognitive impairment (suggesting that it can be used as a nootropic) but it appears to require at least a five day loading period.Oxiracetam is a positive AMPA modulator similar in mechanism and potency (but not binding site) to both piracetam andaniracetambut may have an additional benefit of increasing glutamate, acetylcholine, andD-aspartic acidrelease from activated but not resting neurons.

It is commonly seen as the counter-part to sodium when it comes to blood pressure and regulation of water in the body with high potassium diets being associated with reduced blood pressure.Potassium is relatively unique when it comes to the topic of dietary supplements since it cannot legally be sold in levels high enough to provide much benefit due to safety. As an easily absorbed mineral that influences blood pressure, large doses taken in a powder form can be associated with cardiac arrythmia and in a few cases hospitalization. This has largely prevented wide-scale potassium fortification of foods leading this mineral to be a relatively common deficiency. This risk does not seem to apply to when large amounts of potassium are consumed from the fibrous food it is found in as the foods slow the rate of potassium absorption leading to less of a 'spike' in the blood, known as hyperkalemia.When it comes to potassium, benefits are seen when it comes to circulatory disorders such as cardiovascular disease and particularly stroke when potassium intake is increased. This benefit is seen when potassium is consumed in minor increases (additional 500 mg a day) or large increases of a few grams over the course of the day, has similar protective effect regardless of the form of potassium consumed (food or supplemental), and shows benefit even if sodium is held constant."

However, the total amount of protein in potatoes is modest at 4.3 grams per medium spud.[1]Potatoes contain a significant amount of non-essential phytochemicals. These include polyphenols, especially phenolic acids (also found in coffee) and, in purple potatoes specifically, anthocyanins (also found in blueberries),[3]which are most concentrated in the skin but also present in the flesh.[3]Observational research suggests that foods high in polyphenols, including anthocyanins, may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes[4][5].Randomized controlled trials report that these polyphenols found in potatoes reduce blood pressure and improve endothelial function, consistent with the idea that they may lower cardiovascular disease risk.[6][7]However, there is no direct evidence that consuming potatoes prevents cardiovascular events.Yellow-fleshed potatoes can also contain a significant amount of carotenoids, especiallylutein(also found in green vegetables like spinach).[8]Lutein plays a role in preventing and slowing the progression ofmacular degeneration, a common cause of visual impairment in the elderly.[9]"
dd62241b-e861-4d43-a2a7-589d4b0fada9,https://examine.com/foods/potatoes/,Potatoes,What are the main benefits of potatoes?,"Potatoes are one of the richest dietary sources of potassium, an important mineral for keeping blood pressure within a healthy range and preventing cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke.[10][11]A commonly-used dose in studies that report blood pressure reductions from potassium supplementation is 2.3 grams per day, approximately the amount in two medium potatoes.[10][1]One randomized controlled crossover trial compared the impact of non-fried potatoes, fried potatoes, potassium supplements, and usual diet on blood pressure over 17-day diet periods in people with high blood pressure.[12]Systolic blood pressure tended to be lower on the non-fried potato diet vs. usual diet, but this didn’t reach statistical significance. In contrast, the decline in systolic blood pressure from baseline was significantly greater for the non-fried potato group vs. usual diet, but this was a secondary outcome. The decline in blood pressure did not reach statistical significance on the diet with fried potatoes or potassium supplements.An additional small trial reports that eating eight small purple potatoes per day for four weeks reduces blood pressure in people with high blood pressure (hypertension), but the finding should be interpreted with caution due to major methodological weaknesses.[13]For example, the paper doesn’t statistically compare blood pressure in the intervention group against the control group, which is the most important comparison in a controlled trial. Together, these two randomized controlled trials provide modest evidence that eating non-fried potatoes can lower blood pressure, consistent with the high potassium content of spuds.In a study testing the satiety (fullness after a meal) effects of 32 commonly-eaten foods, boiled potatoes were the most sating per calorie, beating other high-satiety foods like fish, steak, fruit, and oatmeal.[14]Baked potatoes are expected to be comparable due to their similar composition and palatability. This suggests that potatoes may be helpful for controlling calorie intake and body weight, although this hasn’t been directly tested. It’s also important to note that this study used plain potatoes, and the effects would likely be different with added butter, cheese or other calorie-dense toppings.Potatoes are unusually nutritionally complete. Although a potato-only diet lacks significant quantities of vitamins A, E, and B12, most other essential nutrients are present at adequate or near-adequate levels. Small experiments in the early 20th century reported that people can eat almost nothing but potatoes for 5.5 to 10 months with no apparent ill effects.[15][16]"
2105d484-2736-4891-ac97-c1fe9b9062a9,https://examine.com/foods/potatoes/,Potatoes,What are the main drawbacks of potatoes?,"Most types of potatoes, such as the common russet, have a high glycemic index. This means they increase blood glucose more than most other foods containing the same amount of carbohydrate. However, this varies by potato type and processing method. For example, frying potatoes, or cooling them after cooking, tends to lower their glycemic index.[17]Potatoes also have a high insulin index, meaning they increase insulin secretion more than most other foods.[18]The health implications of this aren’t entirely clear. Observational studies report no consistent association between the habitual glycemic index of the diet and body mass index, a measure of body fatness. Similarly, randomized controlled trials report no consistent effect of glycemic index on body weight.[19]In contrast, observational studies report that diets higher in glycemic index tend to be associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes,[20][21]and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in women but not men.[22][23][24]In addition, people with diabetes may have a harder time controlling their blood sugar levels when they eat high-glycemic foods.[25]When considering potatoes specifically, there is no consistent association between the intake of boiled, baked, or mashed potatoes and cardiovascular risk in observational studies, but they are correlated with a slightly higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Intake of fried potatoes is more strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in these studies, despite the lower glycemic index of fried potatoes.[26][27]Potatoes contain oxalates, which can contribute to the formation of kidney stones in susceptible people.[28][29]Potatoes also contain the toxic glycoalkaloids solanine and chaconine, which can cause digestive distress and in very rare cases can be fatal. These are only present in potentially dangerous amounts in potatoes that are green, damaged, diseased, and potato sprouts. Peeling potatoes removes most of their glycoalkaloid content.[30]Per calorie, potatoes are not as dense in vitamins and minerals as low-calorie vegetables like greens, broccoli, and carrots. This isn’t necessarily a problem if potatoes are eaten as a starch alongside vegetables, as one would eat rice or bread. But if they’re viewed as a vegetable and eaten instead of low-calorie vegetables, they may lead to a lower intake of vitamins and minerals and a higher calorie intake."
d5e262d2-222c-4b62-8907-7ff622f7d76f,https://examine.com/foods/potatoes/,Potatoes,How does preparation method impact the healthfulness of potatoes?,"Potatoes are commonly eaten baked, boiled, mashed, and fried. Relative to the other three preparation methods, frying results in a lower glycemic index, higher calorie density, greater palatability, and lower satiety per calorie.[17][14]This is likely to increase calorie intake and contribute to weight gain. Consistent with this, an observational study reported that people who increase their intake of French fries and potato chips experienced much more weight gain than people who increased their intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes.[31]This must be interpreted with some caution due to the possibility of confounding by other diet and lifestyle factors. Adding calorie-dense toppings or ingredients like butter and cheese to baked, boiled, and mashed potatoes is expected to make them less filling per calorie.Cooling potatoes after cooking tends to reduce their glycemic index and insulin index, even if they are subsequently reheated, although this is not always the case.[32][33]To the extent that dietary glycemic index and insulin index may impact health, cooling potatoes prior to eating may make them healthier.High-temperature cooking of some foods creates a carcinogen called acrylamide, and fried potatoes are one of the largest dietary exposures to this compound.[34]Although dietary acrylamide is a theoretical concern, observational studies have not reported consistent links between dietary acrylamide intake and the risk of cancer at any site, with the possible exception of kidney cancer.[35]Soaking potatoes prior to frying reduces the formation of acrylamide."

It appears to be quite stable as it can undergo several thousand cycles before being used up, and it is novel since it associates with protein structures inside the cell (some antioxidants, mostly notably carotenoids like β-carotene andastaxanthin, are located at specific areas of a cell where they exert proportionally more antioxidant effects due to proximity; PQQ seems to do this near proteins like carotenoids do so at the cell membrane).The aforementioned REDOX functions can alter protein function and signalling pathways, and while there is a lot of promisingin vitro(outside of a living model) research on what it could do there are only a few promising results of PQQ supplementation, mostly related to either altering some signalling pathways or via its benefits to mitochondria (producing more of them and increasing their efficiency).It is a coenzyme in bacteria (so, to bacteria, this would be something like a B-vitamin) but this role does not appear to extend to humans. Since this does not extend to humans, the designation of PQQ as a vitamin compound has fallen through and it is only considered 'vitamin-like' at best.PQQ seems to modify oxidation in a cell after binding to some proteins, and this modulatory role it plays can alter the signalling processes that go on in a cell. Due to PQQ being a REDOX agent (capable of both reducing and oxidizing) it is not a pure antioxidant, but it is involved in a cyclical antioxidative cycle with an antioxidant enzyme known as glutathioneFor human evidence, the limited evidence we have right now suggests a possible neuroprotective role in the aged (no research in clinical situations of neurodegeneration nor in youth) and it may have an antiinflammatory role. This limited evidence also suggests that the main claim of PQQ, an enhancement of mitochondrial function, occurs in otherwise healthy humans given PQQ supplementation.The animal evidence that might apply to humans (using oral supplementation at doses similar to what humans use) include a radioprotective effect, possible benefits to insulin resistance, and being a growth factor when PQQ is added to the diet over a long period of time. Higher than normal oral doses in rodents seem to also enhance peripheral neurogenesis (nerve growth outside of the brain) but not necessarily in the brain.A large amount of the evidence for adirectantioxidant role or the neurological actions related to NMDA signalling of PQQ seem to use very high concentrations in cells, due to possible transportation issues to the brain and low concentrations of PQQ found in the blood following oral ingestion.It holds a potential to modify signalling in humans, and although the oxidation in the blood (easiest thing to measure) in mostly unaffected it also retains the potential to act as an intracellular antioxidant. The enhancement of mitochondrial function may also occur, but beyond some alterations in signalling and the mitochondrial biogenesis most other properties of PQQ are unlikely to extend to humans"

Human studies support this, but they are limited in statistical power and currently there are no human studies in otherwise healthy youth for the purpose of cognitive enhancement.The mechanisms of pramiracetam are not well known, but it appears to alter EEG activity in all tested rats (young and old) and may be able to enhance high-affinity choline uptake. It is similar to piracetam and other racetams in the sense that its mechanisms seem dependent on the adrenal glands and some peripheral effects, but beyond that the mechanisms have not been further elucidated."

One human study has also been done on PRL-8-53. Each participant ingested a placebo and PRL-8-53, at separate times, in a double blind crossover study. Participants then took a memory test, consisting of twelve monosyllabic words in a particular order. The test was conducted three times, immediately after supplementation, one day after supplementation, and four days after supplementation.People that remembered more than eight words after taking a placebo experienced minor benefits, but people over 30 or with poor short term memory benefitted greatly from supplementation. In some cases, their score on the word test doubled.No side effects were observed in the human study, and preliminary rodent evidence suggests PRL-8-53 is safe. Using PRL-8-53 as a dietary supplement, however, cannot be recommended at this time because it is a synthetic substance and all of the evidence for its effects comes from studies funded by the holder of the patent.

It is commonly known by the brand name Metamucil.Psyllium is used clinically as a bulk laxative, an agent that has laxative effects but secondary to increasing fecal size; a gentler laxative relative to agents likecaffeineorsenna alexandrina. This bulk occurs due to water and gas absorption in the small intestines and colon to give chyme (made from digested food) more size and softness. This bulk is retained in the colon despite microflora as psyllium is poorly fermented (highly fermented fibers may be metabolized by bacteria in the colon, and water retaining properties with the fiber would be lost in this scenario).Psyllium increases fecal size and moisture, and the most common characteristics of stool following supplementation of psyllium are 'soft, sleek, and easily passable.' Relative to other sources of dietary fiber, psyllium appears to be more effective at forming feces and appears to be one of the few fiber sources not associated with excessive flatulence.Beyond the fecal properties, psyllium appears to be able to reducetotal cholesterolandLDL-Cin persons with high cholesterol (secondary to the gel forming properties leeching bile acids, and cholesterol being used up to replace hepatic bile acids) and there is sometimes a slight reduction ofHDL-Cas well. This is common to all water soluble dietary fibers and is not unique to psyllium.There appears to be some glucose reducing properties associated with psyllium supplementation that may beneficial for diabetes. These are not overly potent, but appear reliable as long as psyllium is taken; cessation of psyllium usage is associated with a loss of the glucose reduction, and this may be common to all soluble dietary fibers rather than just psyllium.Psyllium may reduceappetiteslightly when taken in high doses, but does not appear to be potent or reliable; long term studies using psyllium in the doses for fecal management have failed to findweightreducing properties of psyllium suggesting it is not a good weight management intervention.In very rare cases, supplementation with psyllium — especially in high amounts or when not consumed with sufficient water — can lead to gastrointestinal obstructions. This occurs when the psyllium fiber forms a mass (known as a bezoar) which becomes stuck in an area of the gut. These obstructions are more likely to occur when there is gastrointestinal hypomotility (slow movement of food through the gut) or abnormalities of gastrointestinal anatomy."

Pycnogenol is similar togrape seed extractandcocoa polyphenolsas those are the three most common sources of Procyanidins.Pycnogenol's benefits include increased blood flow (via a mechanism related to increasednitric oxidelevels) and improved blood glucose control. The former exerts cardioprotective effects and may help with erectile dysfunction, while the latter appears to be anti-diabetic.There are many human trials conducted on Pycnogenol, but a good deal of them have industry funding. Although industry funding doesn't necessarily invalidate published results, it should always be noted. Although the range of Pycnogenol research has significant breadth, it also has a relativelackof study replication. Some of the studies of Pycnogenol inautoimmune diseaseare also open-label, meaning that neither the researchers nor the subjects are blinded to treatments. While promising, these results need to be interpreted with a degree of caution since this type of experimental design fails to control for placebo effects or any unconscious bias that may be harbored by researchers analyzing the data. The one topic that appears to have been replicated numerous times is the effects on erectile dysfunction, with the caveat that all of the studies are confounded with the inclusion ofl-arginine. So the effects of Pycnogenol alone on erectile dysfunction are still unknown.Pycnogenol does appear to possess dual anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, with the latter being confirmed in humans and possibly being subject to a build-up effect over time. The low-dose buildup effect of Pycnogenol as an anti-inflammatory agent would make it useful in a multinutrient format, but it may not be the most potent anti-inflammatory in isolation. The degree of measured anti-inflammatory potential on COX enzymes (targets of Aspirin) are still lower than Aspirin itself.Although not the most potent anti-inflammatory agent out there, Pycnogenol has shown some efficacy in alleviating symptoms in patients with autoimmune disease. Although the type of rampant inflammation during a flare far-exceeds the ability of pycnogenol, it has shown some efficacy for patients in remission phases of their disease, where symptoms tend to be driven by lower-level, chronic inflammation. One preliminary study has shown that pycnogenol may be particularly effective for relievingdry eye/dry mouthsymptoms associated with Sjogren’s syndrome, a common autoimmune condition in women."

Rose is one of the more popular oils used in Aromatherapy for the purpose of relaxation.Like most other compounds used in Aromatherapy, scientific support is somewhat lacking. There appears to be a variety of rodent models using the aroma of Rose indicating that it possesses sedative (not too potent) and anxiolytic (surprisingly potent for an aroma) properties, and limited human studies also suggest that this overall 'relaxing' effect applies to both the aroma as well as topical administration of the rose oil. There are some anti-stress effects (at least one human study to support this) and although there are two studies noting that Rose aroma had pain reducing propertes one was confounded with other aromatics (LavenderandClary Sage) while the other used rose essential oil as adjuvant alongside anti-inflammatory medication Diclofenac. Although there is indeed evidence for pain reducing properties, it does not appear to be the best evidence.Due to both topical administration and the aroma being effective, Rose is apparently a common oil to use in massage oils for the purpose of relaxation. The bioactives in rose appeared to be most Rose oxide and Citronellol, which contribute highly to the aroma of rose.Overall, there is sufficient (preliminary) evidence to suspect rose has biologically relevant relaxing properties when used as an aromatic, although larger trials to validate its aromatherapeutic potential would be needed to support its usage as monotherapy."

It improves joint health by reducing pain and stiffness.Preliminary evidence also suggests rose hip may provide benefits to people with diabetes, as well as high blood pressure and cholesterol. It’s hypothesized that rose hip may have an anti-obesity effect, but this claim needs to be confirmed through research.Rose hip alleviates joint pain through its immunosuppressive effects. The immune system can contribute to rheumatic diseases. An inflammatory cytokine called Interleukin 1-Beta (IL-1β) causes cartilage cells to produce proteins that digest and break down join tissue. In moderation, this process encourages cell turnover, but in excess, this process contributes to long-term joint tissue degradation, which is what causes joint problems. While rose hip doesn’t reduce IL-1β levels in the blood, it interferes with its ability to activate catabolic proteins.Rose hip is also able to reduce chemotaxis, which is the transportation of immune cells into tissue. This serves as both an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive mechanism."

d35f72e0-323c-442f-9880-7c23f49008ac,https://examine.com/supplements/roselle/,Roselle,Summary,"Hibiscus Sabdariffa(Roselle) is a supplemental herb that is derived from the plant's calyces, which are the collection of sepals separating the blooming flower from the stem. The calyces have traditionally been steeped into tea where the anthocyanins (red-blue pigmentation) is steeped into the water and drank for medicinal purposes.Although Roselle has a variety of claims medicinally, it appears to have evidence to support its role in reducing blood pressure in persons with elevated blood pressure. This may be through its ACE inhibitory potential (although this is admittedly weak) or by benefiting the endothelium vianitric oxiderelated mechanisms (appears to be in better accordance with the amount of anthocyanins that reach the blood). Reductions in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure have been noted, and for the most part appear to be reliable in presence although not so much in magnitude of benefit (ie. blood pressure is reliably reduced, but the degree of reduction seems to vary).In regards to diabetes and blood glucose control, Roselle appears to have limited evidence to support these claims but the evidence is so far in support. Mechanisms are not known, and the remarkable potency in animal studies seems to be markedly less in the limited human interventions looking at it. Roselle does appear to weakly inhibit carbohydrate absorption enzymes, yet is synergistic withMorus Alba(White Mulberry) in doing so; a tea made of White Mulberries and Roselle, although currently not supportedin vivo, is possibly an effective carbohydrate absorption inhibitory tea.The interactions of Roselle and weight loss are not too clear-cut, and it seems to be highly intertwined with studies on Roselle toxicity; Roselle is known to be toxic in higher doses, and weight loss more often than not precedes chronic toxicity. For studies that note weight loss without toxicity, it seems to be related to reduced food intake in rats and mice rather than direct fat burning effects.The appetite suppressing effects seem to be fairly reliable in rats, but caution should be taken in applying these effects to humans. Aside from not being reported as a side-effect in any human study, the bioactive known as Hibiscus Acid is similarly structured to (-)-Hydroxycitric acid fromGarcinia Cambogiawhich is known to reduce appetite in rats reliably but not humans.Low doses of Roselle tea or supplements appear to be effective in reducing blood pressure, and may be anti-diabetic. It is unlikely that Roselle can cause weight loss independent of a reduction of appetiteThe toxicity itself seems to occur in mice and rats in a similar idea as the blood pressure reducing effects in humans, as in they occur reliably although the dose required to induce toxicity and what exactly occurs seems to vary from one study to another. This may be related to the exact molecules mediating toxicity not being known right now. For the majority of toxic effects, the lowest they have occurred is 200mg/kg in rats (2.2g dried calyx for a 150lb human). Human studies have used this dose or above with no apparent side effects though. The toxicity of these doses of Roselle need to be evaluated more.One concern that does exist is testicular toxicity, which occurs fairly reliably at 200mg/kg or above in animals but has not been investigated in humans. Roselle appears to be anti-fertility in men, inducing abnormal sperm morphology. In females, there was a series of studies suggesting Roselle could cause abnormal (higher) birth weights in offspring with a delay of pubertal onset; for the most part these are attributed to the appetite suppressing effect causing maternal malnutrition, with noper semechanisms harming the pup (via lactation) currently known.Although these toxic effects can possibly be avoided by adhering to proper dosing, the amount of safety information in humans is not as expansive as would be desired; the therapeutic threshold (degree of 'safety buffer' between the active dose and toxic dose) is also lower than desirable, so possible toxic effects with overdosing Roselle is probably more relevant than other supplements.Higher doses of Roselle do exert toxic effects, although none of these toxic effects have been reported in humans (that being said, they have not conclusively been disproven either). It would be prudent to avoid taking too much Roselle, especially since many benefits of Roselle (elaborating on in complete summary) are not dose-dependent above the lowest observable toxic dose of 2.2g/150lb human"

Although lower circulating levels of SAMe are also seen in diabetes, the benefits of SAMe and glucose control are not as well established as depression and osteoarthritis.SAMe appears to follow many nutrient-like motifs in the body, being regulated within a certain serum range and being associated with adverse effects when that range is perturbed. It potentially holds a lot of benefit in body states where circulating SAMe levels decline.Although side-effects are not commonly reported with SAMe, numerous studies note a small set of participants who experience mania after supplementing SAMe. It is not common, but it does appear to be related to SAMe supplementation for unknown reasons; it has been reported in some persons without history of mania as well and does not appear to be related to any pathological conditionper se."

Exercise is another form of hormetic stressor, and indeed, sauna and exercise have very similar (but not identical) physiological effects,[4]which include an increase in heart rate (120–150 beats per minute) and an elevation in skin and skeletal muscle blood flow, among others.It’s worth remembering that, alongside its physiological effects, sauna is also simply a relaxing and pleasurable activity (with cultural significance for many); engaging in such activities is likely to benefit health in its own right."

Sesamin is catered to be a nutritional supplement that confers antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects (if touting its health properties) or possibly being an estrogen receptor modulator and fat burner (if targeting atheltes or persons wishing to lose weight).Sesamin has a few mechanisms, and when looking at it holistically it can be summed up as a fatty acid metabolism modifier. It appears to inhibit an enzyme known as delta-5-desaturase (Δ5-desaturase) which is a rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid metabolism; inhibiting this enzyme results in lower levels of both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, one of the twofish oilfatty acids) as well asarachidonic acid, and this mechanism appears to be relevant following oral ingestion. The other main mechanism is inhibiting a process known as Tocopherol-ω-hydroxylation, which is the rate limiting step in the metabolism ofVitamin E; by inhibiting this enzyme, sesamin causes a relative increase of vitamin E in the body but particularly those of the gamma subset (γ-tocopherol and γ-tocotrienol) and this mechanism has also been confirmed to be active following oral ingestion.There are some other mechanisms in place which seem promising (protection against Parkinson's Disease as well as promotion of bone mass) but most of the mechanisms including estrogen receptor modulation, fat burning from the liver, and activation of the antioxidant response element (ARE) have not been confirmed in humans and have their reasons to suspect that they do not occur; this includes either a concentration that is too high to matter for oral supplementation, or in the case of fat burning it being a process that seems to be exclusive to rats.In the end, sesamin serves a pretty interesting role as having the potential to augment γ-tocopherol and γ-tocotrienol metabolism by preventing their degradation; increasing the levels of these vitamin E vitamers has a lot of therapeutic benefits in and of itself, and since they are quite expensive to purchase as supplements then sesamin could be a cheap workaround or something used to 'cut' the vitamin E."

The main mechanism of action of sodium bicarbonate is in negating the effects of acidosis. It provides benefits both in situations of chronic mild acidosis, commonly seen in metabolic ailments or during aging as kidney function slowly declines, and in exercise-induced acidosis.In athletes, the standard doses of sodium bicarbonate supplementation (200-300 mg/kg) reliably benefits performance when performance on the exercise is heavily influenced by metabolic acidosis, aka “the burn.” Brief high-intensity exercise performance, such as a single-bout of a 30-second Wingate test, does not benefit from supplementation with sodium bicarbonate,[1]but exercise involvingmultiple30-second maximal efforts does, especially if short rest intervals are used between efforts. Supplementation with sodium bicarbonate is also unlikely to enhance performance during low-intensity long-duration exercise, although the evidence is mixed.Overall, supplementation with sodium bicarbonate can enhance performance in high-intensity single- and multiple-bout exercise that last between about 30 seconds and 12 minutes.[2]Benefits of sodium bicarbonate can be observed with a single dose taken 60-150 minutes before exercise, but supplementation should be approached cautiously as it can cause gastrointestinal side effects if too much is taken at once or, if it’s consumed too rapidly.Additionally, 5 g of sodium bicarbonate taken daily appears to be somewhat effective in reducing acidosis induced by the diet or the aging process (although using potassium bicarbonate appears to be better), and therefore it may reduce the rate of bone loss over time in susceptible populations.There are mechanisms in place for sodium bicarbonate to be a fat-burning agent (it increases ketone production and lipolysis and causes a minor increase in metabolic rate), but these have not yet been linked to actual weight loss in trials."

While 200 mg/kg seems to produce an ergogenic effect in most people, 300 mg/kg appears to be the optimal dose. Doses of 400–500 mg/kg are also ergogenic when taken before exercise, but not necessarily more than lower doses. These higher doses also tend to be associated with a higher degree of intestinal side effects.If taking sodium bicarbonate acutely for exercise, a dose can be taken 60-150 minutes before anaerobic activities associated with metabolic acidosis (i.e., “the burn”) for maximum benefit.In studies that used a multiple day (3 to 7 days) supplementation protocol, an overall sodium bicarbondate dose of 500 mg/kg divided into four smaller doses taken throughout the day was more effective than an overall dose 300 mg/kg.[2]Some health effects (increase in metabolic rate or attenuation of metabolic acidosis) can be achieved at more reasonable doses, such as 5-10 g, and may be more practical for nonathletes.Additionally, as 27.3% of sodium bicarbonate's weight is due to sodium, every 100 mg/kg confers about 27 mg/kg sodium to the diet; this needs to be accounted for, and severely limits usage by persons with salt-sensitive hypertension.As the doses are measured in reference to body weight, obesity may result in a falsely high oral dose. If you are not within a normal or overweight BMI range, estimate your oral dose based on your “ideal weight” instead.The means of consuming bicarbonate is important, as excessively high doses or rapid ingestion can cause gastric upset due to a reaction between bicarbonate and stomach acid. Bicarbonate should be sipped slowly over a period of a few minutes with a moderate amount of water (500 mL), and the first time bicarbonate is used a half-dose should be ingested to assess tolerance.Rapidly ingesting the drink, or taking too much, is likely to induce stomach pain and nausea within an hour followed by increased diarrhea and flatulence; sticking to 200 mg/kg may alleviate the risk of these side effects.Independent of the dose taken, caution should be exercised with the manner by which sodium bicarbonate is ingested, so as to minimize intestinal and gastric side effects; these side effects occur with rapid or excessive consumption of bicarbonate, and include nausea and diarrhea."

They surmised, instead, that people with CD were intolerant to all disaccharide and polysaccharide sugars.[1][2]Based on this theory, the SCD consisted primarily ofripe bananas and calcium caseinate, which were — according to Sydney V. Haas, MD — tolerable due to their low di- and polysaccharide content and provided adequate calories and protein to treat CD-associated weight loss. Certain foods could be reintroduced gradually, with tolerance indicated largely by bowel habits. The diet was intended to last 12 months, at which point the excluded carbohydrates could be gradually reintroduced. From the mid-1920s through the mid-1950s, Dr. Haas and his associate (another Dr. Haas — his son, Merrill P.)treated about 800 patientswith the SCD.[2]The diet was repopularized in the 1990s by Elaine Gottschall, a biochemist (and, purportedly, the mother of one of Sydney Haas’s patients). After her daughter was diagnosed with CD, Gottschall wrote a book about the SCD, claiming it could cure CD as well as other conditions, such as IBD, diverticulitis, andautism spectrum disorder(ASD). However, these claims have not been substantiated.[3]"

Although other fruits could be introduced later on, it was thought that they could worsen diarrhea if given too early; eggs and vegetables were to be reintroduced gradually once diarrhea had subsided. Potatoes, corn, rice, wheat, rye, table sugar, corn syrup, and whole milk — though not sour cream — were permanently excluded. Early publications reported that most children tolerated starch after 12–18 months on the diet, and patients could return to a normal diet as long as their symptoms didn’t recur.[2]In Gotschall’s version of the diet, most fresh fruits and vegetables, certain legumes, unprocessed meats, low-lactose dairy products, and honey are permitted. Potatoes, yams, canned fruits and vegetables, milk, and processed foods are excluded.[4]"
45b52039-e968-4e52-803f-78452de65b78,https://examine.com/diets/spec-carb-diet/,Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD),How effective is the SCD?,"Despite numerous anecdotal reports of improvement inCrohn’s disease, ASD, and inflammation, most of the SCD research comes fromobservational data and case studies. Early research using case studies and retrospective surveys failed to collect dietary data, and many patients were also taking medications to manage their IBD. A majority of patients reported occasionally eating restricted foods — or even reintroducing them entirely — but the majority also reported that their symptoms improved after implementing the SCD.One prospective studyfollowed children for up to 1 year after starting the SCD, and researchers observed healing of the intestinal lining in some participants, but others failed to improve, and some even worsened. That same year, a small retrospective study found no signs of mucosal healing (healing of the innermost layer of the bowel) in children who had been reported to be using the SCD. Retrospective chart reviews of patients following the SCD suggest that strict implementation of the diet is associated with symptom improvement, but they also highlight the difficulty that patients experience in adhering to the diet.The SCD and other restrictive diets have been suggested as treatments for ASD, despite thelack of supporting evidence from placebo-controlled trials.Research on the SCD in ASD is currently limited to one 16-week case study and anonline survey administered to 256 caregiversof children with ASD.Surprisingly, despite the lack of evidence supporting the use of the SCD in children with ASD, half of the caregivers reported starting their children on the diet after a practicing physician recommended it. Additionally, 40% reported receiving guidance from dietitians or nutritionists trained in SCD application. Caregivers reported starting the children on the SCD at an average of about 5½ years old and following it for an average of 2.7 years. Prior to the SCD, 64% of the children were following gluten-free, casein-free diets (which have been studied more extensively and currently appear ineffective.)[5]A large majority of the caregivers reported improvements in the children’s abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and food variety, as well as self-injurious behavior, irritability, anxiety, toilet training, and language skills after SCD implementation. However, the questionnaire used in this study has not been validated for research; dietary intake data was never collected; and the findings weren’t controlled for the use of medications, time spent on the SCD, or the presence of IBD in some of the children. Likewise, the child in the 16-week case study also improved, but the researchers can’t rule out other explanations for the changes.An exploratory,open-label studyassigned 22 children with juvenile idiopathic (from an unknown cause) arthritis to the SCD for 4 weeks with no control group. The dropout rate was also high in this case, with only 15 children completing the intervention. They reported improvements in morning stiffness, pain, and physical function, and several of their inflammatory proteins decreased by the end of the trial. The short-chain fatty acidbutyrateincreased, as well, which is helpful for colon function.So far, just two randomized trials (RCTs) have been performed in people with Crohn’s disease. Though preliminary findings suggest improvements in some markers of inflammation, a lack of quality RCTs makes it difficult to determine the efficacy of the SCD.[4][1]In a12-week RCTthat enrolled nearly 200 participants with mild to moderate Crohn’s disease, researchers compared the effects of the SCD and a Mediterranean-style diet (MD). Both groups ate more fruits and vegetables and reported improvements in fatigue, pain, sleep quality, and social isolation. Though both groups also reported similar rates of remission (either lessening or going away entirely) of symptoms (46.5% in the SCD and 43.5% in the MD), their intestinal and systemic inflammatory markers didn’t change after either diet. Given the comparable effects of these diets, the researchers concluded that the MD may be a superior intervention, due to it being easier to follow. This study experienced a high dropout rate (30 participants from the MD group and 35 from the SCD group), and participants reported that they were unlikely to adhere to a restrictive diet for longer than 6 weeks.Another 12-week trial randomized 18 pediatric patients with active Crohn’s disease to either a strict SCD, modified SCD (which included oats and rice), or whole-foods diet (which excluded only wheat, corn, sugar, milk, and food additives). There were high dropout rates in this study also; only 10 of the participants completed it. But researchers reported that all 10 achieved clinical remission and reductions in intestinal and systemic inflammation.[1]The SCD is no more effective than the MD or a whole-foods diet for people with Crohn’s disease. The SCD is not currently a scientifically supported intervention for ASD, and more research is needed to determine its efficacy in juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Since participants knew about their dietary changes, and none of these studies included a control group, the results could have been influenced by the placebo effect and other changes associated with a new diet.Though the Haases didn’t intentionally restrictgluten(or even believe it played a role in CD), they coincidentally eliminated it from their patients’ diets by removing grains. This early gluten-free diet could have been effective for the patients with CD, but formal clinical trials were never performed. Because the SCD eliminates grains and certain starchy foods, it may also reduce theFODMAP(fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols — carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine — ) content, which could explain some of the gastrointestinal (GI) improvements. However, the FODMAP content of the diet has not been studied.Limited, low-quality evidence suggests that the SCD is as effective as the Mediterranean diet for improving symptoms of Crohn's disease, but it is not currently a scientifically supported intervention for autism spectrum disorder."

Though their energy needs were met, most of the children’s intakes of calcium and vitamin D were much lower than the RDA, so the researchers acknowledged the importance of supplementation while following the SCD.[7]The diet may also be hard to sustain. Many participants dropped out of studies or reported difficulty adhering to the diet. Dropout rates in the RCTs ranged from about 20 to 40%, and the surveyed caregivers reported spending 6–9 hours per week on food preparation for the children’s SCD.[5]"

Unlike bacopa, however, jatamansi does not have as much evidence to support it and is currently in a preliminary stage of research.When looking at the neural research, at least one study has supported jatamansi in promoting cognition of otherwise healthy young rodents and restoring cognition in older rats; this study outperformed the reference drugPiracetam, but other studies assessing cognitive enhancement are not too common. There appears to be more evidence on the neuroprotective properties of jatamansi (which, although the studies are too heterogeneous to come to any solid conclusions, seem very promising) and one study suggested potent anti-depressive effects associated with jatamansi. Perhaps intriguinly, jatamansi is a rare herb that has been demonstrated to have a calming effect despite increasing brain monoamines (which is normally correlated with psychostimulation).Beyond the brain, jatamansi appears to have general antioxidative effects (seems a lot more potentin vivorather thanex vivo; with studies outside the body being about a tenth as effective asVitamin Cand not at all impressive) and has a surprisingly amount of evidence in rodents to support jatamansi as protective against pancreatitis.

It may refer to a number of different species in theArthrospiragenus, namelyplatensisandmaxima. Spirulina is often used as a vegan source of protein and iron and is rich in a variety of other nutrients and phytochemicals. It is believed by some to provide vitamin B12, but it actually contains the dubious pseuodovitamin B12 which hasn't been shown to be effective. Spirulina has a few notable active components. The main ingredient is called phycocyanobilin, which makes up about 1% of spirulina. This compound mimics the body’s bilirubin compound, in order to inhibit an enzyme complex called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. By inhibiting NADPH oxidase, spirulina provides potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.What are spirulina's benefits?Evidence suggests a general improvement in the basic components of the lipid panel: triglycerides, HDL, LDL, VLDL, and total cholesterol. It seems to reduce blood pressure by a small amount, and may have some meaningful effects on liver enzymes and overall liver health, though more research is needed on that. It also seems to improve general antioxidant status and reduce markers of oxidative stress, as well as some inflammatory markers. When people take spirulina, they tend to lose a small amount of weight, even if they're not trying to, and there's some evidence to suggest that it can help regulate appetite.Because of its potentially potent immunomodulating properties, spirulina may have utility for preventing allergic reactions and treating asthma. However, there's only a small amount of research for these indications.

This sweetness is traced back to glycoside (bound to sugar) compounds of steviol, with the two most important steviol glycosides being stevioside and rebaudioside A.Unlike other sweetening agents such as aspartame or sucralose, ingestion of stevia in feasible doses confers pharmacological activity. Ingestion of either stevioside or rebaudioside A will result in a circulating level of steviol and its conjugate (steviol glucuronide) which can then exert effects in the body.In low doses, stevia consumption appears to be associated with general anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects; these effects have been linked to protection of the kidneys, pancreas, liver, and brain when they precede damaging stressors (so although there is some organ protective effects, it is merely due to the general properties of steviol rather than a unique mechanism). Higher doses appear to be linked to fertility problems in animals, and although it is somewhat contested of an issue (some studies in male rats not showing anti-fertility actions, lack of human studies) it may be prudent to not overconsume stevia due to this.In regards to the genotoxic effects, although overconsumption (or selective choosing of bacterial plates to conduct an Ames test in) is associated with genotoxic effects the potency of this genotoxic effect when it occurs appears to be quite minimal. Cancer causing effects of stevia overconsumption may not be overly relevant due to the low potency of the steviol glycosides and the inherent antioxidant properties also conferring a protective effects (perhaps regulating its own genotoxicity, definitely reduces the reliability) and as such should not be too much of a concern."

However, taurine has shown promise for reducing symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness and accelerating strength recovery following exercise.[23]"

The primary mechanism by which taurine acts as an antioxidant is unclear. Taurine may have the ability to directly scavenge free radicals,[25]but it's more likely that taurine works by regulating antioxidant enzymes and inhibiting generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.[15][26]Taurine may have cardioprotective effects by decreasing oxidative stress and a few other mechanisms. It can modify blood lipids by binding to bile acids and facilitating the breakdown and excretion of cholesterol.[26][18]Additionally, it reduces blood pressure by enhancing vasodilation (i.e., a relaxation of blood vessels, leading to an increase in blood flow).[17][28]Taurine may also reduce blood pressure by reducing production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor within the renin-angiotensin system.[29]Muscle contraction is triggered by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Taurine may improve physical performance by increasing the calcium-storing ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as increasing the sensitivity of force-generating proteins (i.e., actin and myosin) to calcium, thus increasing muscle force.[30][31]With special reference to endurance exercise, taurine may aid performance by increasing the use of fat for fuel and reducing the contribution from glycogen, as well as improving the function of mitochondria.[30]"

It has a large variety of bioactives, with the water extract showing promise at improving left ventricle function of the heart without any observable toxicity of side effects when taken at 500mg thrice a day (every 8 hours).There are numerous human studies conducted on Arjuna bark, although many of them are low in sample size. Nevertheless, the water extract appears to be effective in improving cardiac function in persons who have recently undergone cardiac trauma or injury; Myocardial Infarction is the most commonly researched ailment in this regard. Only one study exists on otherwise healthy persons, but Arjuna showed benefit in improving left ventricle function in an exercise test and the benefits may affect a person regardless of health state.In animal models, this extract appears to exert protection on cardiac tissue in response to various cardiac insults including beta(2)adrenergic agonists (likeephedrine, although isoproterenol was used in the studies) and catecholamines themselves.The water extract appears to be effective for improving cardiovascular health, particularly at the level of left ventricle function. The studies in humans are underpowered at this moment in time and only one in healthy humans (preliminary evidence), but all evidence appears to be promising and in the same positive direction. The water extract appears to be quite safeOther extracts such as ethanolic or acetone, with different bioactives, may not have similar cardioprotective effects (no human trials, but somein vitroevidence suggesting the bioactives are not in these extracts) yet appear to be somewhat cancer protective. Tumor growth in animal models is reduced with either the ethanolic extract or isolated Arjunolic Acid (commonly seen as the main bioactive) as is reduced DNA damage in response to mutagens, and these are attributed to the antioxidative capacity of Arjuna which is comparable toVitamin Con a per weight basis. Due to the anti-cancer effects of the ethanolic extract having some cytotoxic properties, and LD50has actually been established with this extract and it is possible that side-effects may occur. Additionally, the anti-cancer evidence is somewhat limited as although cytotoxicity has been established in cancer cells a lack of evidence exists to assess healthy cells (a good anti-cancer drug will be highly selective in killing cancer cells, which Arjuna does, and not healthy cells, which Arjuna has not been sufficiently tested for).Other possible uses of Arjuna include ulcer protection in the stomach with potency similar to Rantidine in one study (associated with the ethanolic extract), protection to the liver and kidney likely mediated by antioxidative properties (ethanolic extract) and the cardiovascular properties may increase anaerobic cardiovascular performance in healthy persons (with the one study using sprinting as a test) although this last claim has a lone study in support of it and no replication.Ethanolic extracts have potent antioxidative and potentially potent anticancer effects, but although there are no reported side effects with the ethanolic extracts currently (due to a lack of human interventions) it is theoretically plausible that higher than recommended doses could be harmful related to the anticancer effects (cytotoxicity)"

It is actually an omega-3 fatty acid, but has a sulfur group at the omega-3 position; because of this addition it cannot be burnt for energy and thus has no relevant caloric value to humans.PPARa activation can be seen as protecting the body from excess fats (similar to PPARy activation). PPARa tends to clear fats from the blood into muscle or liver cells, and encourage them to be burnt for energy in these locations (by comparison, PPARy makes new fat cells for fats to reside in which minimizes their potential toxicity).The clearing of fat from the blood causes a drop in lipoproteins and a lowering of LDL cholesterol, and the burning of fats causes either fat burning or reduced fat gain. TTA can also decrease blood pressure and exert an anti-oxidant effect, the four mechanisms making it a cardioprotective compound.It is commonly used with the appetite suppressantoleoylethanolamideas a fat-burning combination."

Similar to caffeine there is a sedative effect at relatively low doses, but where this sedative effect with caffeine is at an impractically low dose with theacrine it is the dose normally consumed by tea; this may underlie why Kucha tea tends to be recommended for relaxation more than stimulation.The one study that noted stimulation with theacrine failed to find any tolerance over the course of seven days, a time frame where caffeine would normally show tolerance. This suggests that the body either does not or may have a reduced tolerance to theacrine, but this requires more research (including oral studies) to assess further.At this moment in time, theacrine looks interesting due to being one of a few compounds to be involved in adenosine signalling but not enough research exists to pinpoint where it may or may not be useful as a supplement."

When regular bile salts reach the intestines, they can be metabolized by bacteria into UDCA and then later bound to ataurinemolecule to become TUDCA.TUDCA is a water-soluble bile salt, which is in contrast to regular bile salts possessing both water soluble and fat soluble ends and conferring a detergent effect. This is good for the bile salt's biological purpose (emulsifying fats in the intestines to help with absorption) but when bile acids back up in the liver, a clinical state called cholestasis which occurs when the liver is unhealthy, these bile salts can be damaging to cells by destroying the membranes and signalling for cell death. TUDCA and other water soluble bile salts like UDCA compete with this toxicity and thus indirectly protect cells from death.Additionally, it seems that TUDCA is able to reduce stress to any cell'sEndoplasmic Reticulum; an organelle in cells that serves as a highway from the nucleus out into the cytoplasm, and aids in folding proteins. Through reducing ER stress, TUDCA has been implicated in a wide range of beneficial metabolic effects such as reducing insulin resistance and diabetes, and being a neurological protection agent. However, usages of TUDCA beyond the liver are preliminary whereas usage of TUDCA for helping an already harmed liver is quite reliable as TUDCA is used in clinical settings (hospitals) for treating cholestasis."

More specifically, CII peptides are thought to induce the formation ofregulatory T cells(Tregs) in areas of the gut known as Preyer’s patches. These Tregs can enter circulation, where they produce anti-inflammatory compounds (e.g., IL-10), which in theory can inhibit inflammation and tissue damage in joints.The hydrolysis of type II collagen seems to result in the breakdown of the most immunologically active peptides, meaning that the effect of hydrolyzed collagen on joints may not act via this mechanism. However, in higher doses, hydrolyzed CII might improve joint pain by supplying the amino acids used to repair the damaged tissue."

Appropriate supplementation can also help. If this is the case, a vegan diet is not only healthy, but may even have some advantages over a standard omnivorous diet.First, a vegan diet can be more satiating than a regular omnivorous diet. This is because vegans eat more fiber-rich, low-calorie plant foods while avoiding nutrient-dense, processed animal products. Consequently, vegans often consume fewer calories than people eating a regular diet.[8][9]Second, a vegan diet may lower the risk of certain lifestyle diseases. For instance, a plant-based diet is linked to lower incidence and mortality from ischemic heart disease (-25%) and incidence from total cancer (-8%), according to a comprehensive meta-analysis of 86 cross-sectional and 10 prospective cohort studies.[10]To find out more about how a vegan diet could reduce the risk of lifestyle diseases,click here.Overall, a vegan diet — if it is well designed — can be considered healthy.

Vinpocetine is also commonly used as a nootropic compound in the hopes that it may promote memory formation.Vinpocetine is not fully absorbed, but what is absorbed peaks in the blood rapidly and easily enters the brain where it can exert its functions. The properties that appear to apply to oral vinpocetine supplementation include neuroprotection (against toxins and excess stimulation) and reducing neural inflammation, whereas the cognitive enhancement effect does not appear to be well supported by evidence at this point in time. While vinpocetine does appear to be effective in preventing toxins or stressors from causing amnesia, it is not yet demonstrated to inherently improve memory formation.Vinpocetine also appears to have some efficacy against cognitive decline, but the amount of literature on this topic is much less than other drugs tested for this purpose (CDP-CholineorAlpha-GPCin particular). At least one study has noted an improvement in reaction time with a 40mg tablet of vinpocetine, which may be one of the only practically relevant improvements for healthy persons at this moment in time.Infusions of vinpocetine do appear to enhance blood flow to the brain without inherently modifying pressure systemically, and this is thought (but not shown) to apply to oral ingestion. This would potentially reduce headaches caused by excessive pressure, and is in accordance with the traditional usage of the periwinkle plant (to reduce headaches).Vinpocetine appears to have a role in neuroprotection and reducing neural inflammation, and for healthy persons it may potentially increase blood flow to the brain and improve reaction time (Limited evidence all around). The benefit of vinpocetine in memory formation is not yet proven, but it may protect the brain from amnesiaThe mechanisms of vinpocetine are numerous. It appears to interact with several ion channels (sodium, potassium, and calcium) while tends to result in suppressive effects on neurotransmitter release and neuroprotection when dopamine or glutamate are suppressed (these two, when unnecessarily stimulated by toxins, can cause oxidative damage). It also interacts with alpha adrenergic receptors and the TPSO receptor, and while the exact benefit of these receptor interactions are not clear they are probably relevant since they occur at the same concentrations that the ion channel interactions do.Vinpocetine is also a PDE1 inhibitor, which is a mechanism that is both cardioprotective and cognitive enhancing. Unfortunately, this inhibition occurs at a fairly large dose and may not apply to standard supplemental dosages of vinpocetine.Similar to PDE1, an antidopaminergic potential of vinpocetine and direct inhibition of glutaminergic receptors both appear to occur at very high concentrationsin vitroand may not be relevant to standard supplementation.Vinpocetine is likely a modulator of ion channel activity, although there are some receptor interactions on alpha-adrenergic and TSPO that appear to be relevant. Other mechanisms including PDE1 inhibition or hindering glutaminergic/dopaminergic neurotransmission have been notedin vitrobut at concentrations which are much higher and thus may not be relevant following oral ingestion of vinpocetineVinpocetine has been linked to fetal toxicity in a series of animal studies.

Some proteins in the body are dependent on these cofactors to function optimally and dietary riboflavin is the sole provider of FAD and FMN for these enzymes, which are called flavoproteins since FAD and FMN are 'flavins' and work in concert with these proteins.True deficiencies of riboflavin result in a condition known as ariboflavinosis, which is fairly rare in first world countries but characterized by various ailments of mucuous membranes (mouth and throat) and the skin as well as eye problems. Suboptimal deficiencies are somewhat prevalent although not common aside from a few groups, and for the most part do not result in any major health-threatening conditions.Groups that would benefit from riboflavin supplementation include adolescent and young adult women, particularly in the UK where riboflavin is not fortified in food to as high a level as in the US and Canada, and the elderly which tend to have less than optimal intakes of riboflavin.Beyond merely supporting a good riboflavin status, supplementation has a possible benefit for cardiovascular health in a certain population. People who have two copies of a certain gene, known as MTHFR 677TT, have a condition where homocysteine is abnormally elevated due to defects in folate metabolism. These people may experience reductions in blood pressure and homocysteine when riboflavin is supplemented at a low dose. Higher doses of riboflavin (at around 400mg taken in split doses throughout the day) may also have a therapeutic effect for migraines.Overall, riboflavin is a vitamin which someone could not ingest enough of if their diet is poor, yet a better diet could correct this. Supplementation is never mandatory but is likely prudent for people who are confirmed to be MTHFR 677TT or for anemics on iron repletion therapy (where optimizing riboflavin intake would aid the utility of supplemental iron)."

Nicotinamide is used for topical application because it does not result in the flushed skin that niacin supplementation can cause.Current evidence suggests prolonged niacin supplementation increases insulin resistance because it hinders the ability of insulin to suppress glucose synthesis in the liver. This causes an increase in blood glucose levels, which leads to lowered insulin sensitivity over time, since the relevant receptor is eventually desensitized to the elevated glucose levels in the blood.The flush caused by niacin supplementation is a temporary effect. Though it may be uncomfortable, it is not harmful. There are many case studies describing people overdosing on niacin in an effort to pass a urine test.Niacin overdose results in multiple organ failure and is not effective at masking a urine test."

a38f03a3-80a3-4ae8-ac3e-0571eeceffd5,https://examine.com/supplements/vitamin-e/,Vitamin E,Summary,"Vitamin E is a term used to refer to eight molecules, which are divided into two categories: tocopherols and tocotrienols. Each category is further divided up into alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), and delta (δ) vitamers. The vitamer α-tocopherol is considered to be the ‘main’ vitamer, but the gammas (γ-tocopherol and γ-tocotrienol) are also popular research topics, due to their presence in the diet. Collectively, these compounds are called vitamin E. Vitamin E supplements almost always contain α-tocopherol.The majority of vitamin E’s benefits come from avoiding a deficiency, but there are several instances where supplementation can offer additional benefits. Supplementing α-tocopherol is able to improve T-cell mediated immune function, which boosts the immune system.Vitamin E also seems to be able to enhance the body’s antibody response to vaccinations. Vitamin E is particularly important for the elderly, since a deficiency is associated with a higher risk of bone fractures. Supplementing additional vitamin E, however, will not provide additional benefits to bone health. Vitamin E may also be able to protect against age-related cognitive decline, but further research is needed before supplementation can be recommended specifically for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s treatment.Vitamin E was one of the first two antioxidant compounds to be sold as dietary supplements, the second beingvitamin C. It is sometimes used as the ‘reference’ antioxidant compound when fat soluble compounds are being researched. Vitamin E may function as a signaling molecule within cells and for phosphate groups.Since the majority of vitamin E’s benefits are associated with low doses slightly above the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), vitamin E supplementation is not always necessary. Dietary changes can singlehandedly prevent a vitamin E deficiency and eliminate the need for supplementation. Sesame seeds in particular contain a lot of tocotrienols, as well assesamin, which improves the retention of vitamin E. Low-dose vitamin E is safe to supplement, but it should not be mixed with coumarin-based anticoagulants like warfarin. High-dose long-term vitamin E supplementation (above 400IU per day), however, may be associated with increased risk of death and increased risk of prostate cancer."

This dose of vitamin E can be acquired through the diet, making supplementation unnecessary in many cases. An elderly person supplementing vitamin E to improve immunity should take a 50-200mg dose.Vitamin E supplements should contain α-tocopherol. Avocados, olives, vegetable oils and almonds are all high in vitamin E.Vitamin E's antioxidant properties are improved when taken with unsaturated dietary fat. The minimum intake of vitamin E is 1 IU per gram of unsaturated fat. The ideal range is between 2-4 IU per gram of unsaturated fat.In regards to an upper limit, while doses above 400IU α-tocopherol (268mg) are well tolerated in the short term it is the smallest dose associated with potential long-term adverse effects. If taking vitamin E as a daily supplement for no specific purpose (ie. as part of a multivitamin) then 150mg could be seen as a prudent upper limit."

It is one of the four fat-soluble vitamins, along withvitamin A,vitamin D, andvitamin E. It was named vitamin K after the German word koagulation, because vitamin K’s role in blood coagulation was first discovered in Germany. Vitamin K can be found in dark green vegetables, matcha tea, and natto (a type of fermented soybeans). Vitamin K can also be found in various animal products.The Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) of vitamin K is sufficient to support healthy blood coagulation. Higher levels of vitamin K, however, may provide additional benefits. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to obtain high levels of vitamin K from food alone. Most people don’t like natto enough to eat 50g a day, so supplementation of vitamin K is a popular option.Vitamin K has at times been found to improve markers of bone health. Despite this, supplementation has inconsistent effects on bone fracture risk.Vitamin K has been suggested to protect cardiovascular health by reducing the calcification and stiffening of arteries. However, a number of clinical trials have found no apparent effect of vitamin K supplementation on arterial calcification. Most of these trials were on people with extensive arterial calcification already present, meaning additional research is needed to determine if vitamin K can prevent tissue calcification before it has started.Vitamin K may have a role to play in cancer therapy. It may also help with regulating insulin sensitivity and (in topical form) may help reduce skin reddening, but more research is needed before strong conclusions can be drawn.Vitamin K’s main mechanism is through the vitamin K cycle, which is a cyclical metabolic pathway that uses vitamin K to modify various proteins. Specifically, vitamin K is used to attach a carbon dioxide molecule onto a glutamate contained in these proteins, allowing the protein to bind calcium ions. These proteins can then utilize calcium ions for various biological processes.Vitamin K is often supplemented alongside vitamin D, since vitamin D also supports bone health. In fact, taking both together may improve the effects of each, since they are believed to work synergistically. Excessive vitamin D can lead to arterial calcification and in animal models vitamin K reduces this buildup."

Surprisingly, there is a large body of repeated rodent evidence to suggest it effective in reducing blood sugar regardless of previous state (toxin-induced diabetic, diet-induced diabetic, genetically diabetic or normal rodents) but with no current human evidence.It merely appears to inhibit absorption of carbohydrates from the intestines, with most potency on inhibiting sugar absorption (fairly weak in inhibiting starch absorption, but is synergistic withHibiscus Sabdariffaon this which would make a nice combination). For the most part, this is tied back into the iminosugar compound known as 1-deoxynojirimycin which is a glucose molecule with a nitrogen attached it it; it inhibits enzymes that have affinity for sugars via competitive inhibition where the enzyme is attracted to the glucose structure but cannot act effectively due to the nitrogen group (which does not exist on sugars normally and hinders the enzyme's functions)There appear to be promising cognitive effects associated with Morus Alba as well, with some evidence suggesting it can increase memory formation and cognition to a level similar toPiracetam; interesting, there are some pyrrole alkaloids in Morus Alba (a structural class of molecules that Piracetam belongs to) but these have not yet been connected to the observed cognitive benefits.Morus Alba may also have respectible benefits to cardiovascular health (with improvements in circulating lipids and cholesterol, with fairly potent reductions in atherosclerotic plaque buildup possibly related to potentin vitroanti-inflammatory properties) but similar to the other claims these have not yet been tested in humans.Currently, the evidence suggests that Morus Alba is a highly promising functional food and tea product that may have benefit as a supplement especially in regards to cognition and glucose control but currently does not have sufficient evidence to suggest how potent these benefits are in humans and whether or not Morus Alba is a 'go-to' supplement."

It looks like a sweet potato and tastes like a pear. While the tuber itself is used in cooking, a syrup derived from the tuber (called yacon syrup) is used as an alternative sweetener.This vegetable is also sometimes called the 'diet potato,' which is thought to be related to its fructooligosaccharide (FOS) content. The FOS benefits gut health and has a prebiotic effect, and they may also have a minor appetite suppressing effect in the obese, which reduces food intake. It is thought to be a good dietary supplement, since its production costs are low and yield is high, so it may be one of the most financially feasible sources of dietary FOS while possibly deter sugar consumption, as yacon syrup itself is sweet.Human studies on yacon are currently limited. One study supports a weight loss effect, which may be due to a reduction in consumed calories, while the other study noted that yacon possesses an anti-motility property (slowing intestinal transit time down) which is known to reduce appetite somewhat. These properties are thought to be related to the FOS content, and are similar to the benefits of FOS from other sources.Rodent studies suggest proliferation of the 'good' bacteria in the colon in accordance with yacon's prebiotic effects, as well as an increase in mineral uptake from the colon, the latter of which is beneficial for bone health. These properties are not yet proven in humans with, but thought to occur since they have been noted to occur in humans with any other source of FOS.There is a tea product made from the leaves of yacon, which is said to be anti-diabetic.

In other words, it targets and inactivates a class of receptors in the nervous system that is responsive to the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (noradrenaline).[117]Alpha-2 receptor antagonism enhances the sympathetic nervous system release of norepinephrine, causing the stimulatory and “hyperadrenergic” effects of yohimbine.Antagonism of alpha-2 receptors also inhibits penile smooth muscle contraction and may enhance nitric oxide-mediated smooth muscle relaxation — the combined effects of which promote erection and explain the improvement in ED symptoms after supplementing with yohimbine.[118]Yohimbine also inhibits the activity of alpha-2 receptors on fat cells — where norepinephrine normally acts to suppress fat release. Inhibition of the antilipolytic effect of norepinephrine allows more lipolysis (fat burning) to occur.[100]"

Dosages in the lower range are typically used as adaily preventative, whereas dosages in the higher range are typically used to treat chronic conditions and zinc deficiency.Zinc supplements contain different forms of zinc. Each of these forms contains different amounts of elemental zinc, which refers to the weight of the zinc molecule by itself, for example:Zinc acetate is approximately 36% zinc by weight; therefore, 140 mg of zinc acetate contains 50 mg of elemental zinc.Zinc picolinate is approximately 21% zinc by weight; therefore, 237 mg of zinc picolinate contains 50 mg of elemental zinc.Zinc citrate is approximately 11% zinc by weight; therefore, 439 mg of zinc citrate contains 50 mg of elemental zinc.The content of zinc sulfate depends on which form is used. Theanhydrous,monohydrate, andheptahydrateforms of zinc sulfate are 41%, 36%, and 23% zinc by weight, respectively; therefore, 123 mg ofanhydrous zinc sulfate, 137 mg ofzinc sulfate monohydrate, and 220 mg ofzinc sulfate heptahydrateeach contain 50 mg of elemental zinc.Zinc gluconate is approximately 14% zinc by weight; therefore, 348 mg of zinc gluconate contains 50 mg of elemental zinc.Zinc monomethionine is approximately 31% zinc by weight; therefore, 163 mg of zinc monomethionine contains 50 mg of elemental zinc.This can be confusing, but most zinc product labels indicate the elemental weight of zinc that each dose provides. For example, if a label says“Zinc (as picolinate) 50 mg”, this means that each dose provides 50 mg of elemental zinc."

To store glucose, your body combines the molecules into apolysaccharide (polymeaning several) called glycogen, which gets stored in your liver and muscles.Insulin (a hormone produced by your pancreas) rises when blood glucose rises;[2]it lowers blood sugar by telling various cells to absorb it — for storage in your liver or muscles or for immediate use — and your liver to stop producing new glucose.[3]The ability of cells to absorb glucose in response to insulin is called insulin sensitivity, and low insulin sensitivity is calledinsulin resistance. The more sensitive you are to insulin, the less resistant, and vice versa.It is also possible to produce too little insulin. If you have type 1 diabetes or are in the late stages of type 2 diabetes, in which case you suffer frominsulin deficiency, glucose can’t be removed efficiently from your blood, causinghyperglycemia(overly high glucose levels).[4]Insulin resistance paves the way for type 2 diabetes, which can cause your blood sugar levels to consistently remain too high for too long.

The symptoms include numbness, tingling, or pain in certain parts of the hand innervated by the median nerve, as shown in Figure 1. It affects around[1][2]3-6% of people, and subjective symptoms are associated[3]with anxiety, depression, and lower quality of life. The major biomechanical risk factors[4]for developing CTS are repetitive motions and forceful motions of the hand, as well as the combination of these two movement patterns. Non-hand-related associations exist[5]as well, such as not exercising, poor overall physical health, and lack of job satisfaction. Other disease states, such as hypothyroidism and diabetes, are also associated[6]with CTS.Compression of the median nerve may cause biochemical changes in the nerve that contribute to damage. Animal studies show that crushing[7]rat nerves increases oxidative stress levels. Furthermore, humans with CTS show higher levels of oxidative stress both in their hand tendon[8]and globally[9]."

4f8f16fc-6167-4147-a51c-68a297010029,https://examine.com/outcomes/cortisol/,Cortisol,Summary,"Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal glands. It is the body’s primary glucocorticoid. It is most commonly associated with the stress response where it rises to trigger gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose) lipolysis (the liberation of fatty acids from glycerol), and glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen to produce glucose), essentially making energy more freely available. This is important for when a threat or an urgency requires a quick burst of energy. In conjunction with other hormones, it participates in the formation of memories associated with stress and trauma.It’s also involved in circadian rhythms and the regulation of diurnal energy levels, generally increasing upon waking, and decreasing throughout the rest of the day to (hopefully) be lowest at bedtime. High evening cortisol is associated with insomnia, and a flattening of the normal daily curve is correlated with a wide range of health issues.Cortisol has an anti-inflammatory effect and is used as a topical anti-inflammatory drug (hydrocortisone). While many health issues derive from inflammation, chronic suppression can reduce the efficacy of the immune system, and this may be an explanation for the link between chronic stress and susceptibility to getting sick.Most of the body’s cortisol is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulins, which prevent binding to glucocorticoid receptors, and cortisol must be freed before it. So much like withtestosterone, what’s most relevant is the amount of unbound cortisol. Cortisol also has a less active form: cortisone. Cortisol testing tends to be of serum or salivary cortisol, though these are only reflective of transient and highly variable effects. Thus, testing on multiple days, continuous monitoring, or other tests such as hair cortisol may be more indicative of longer-term levels."

But changes in BDNF levels don’t appear to occur uniformly across all antidepressants.[10]Today, the serotonin hypothesis has lost much of its credibility with neuroscientists and psychiatrists. Several new biological theories of depression have emerged and gained traction, exploring the roles of neuroinflammation,[11]neurotoxicity (more precisely, excitotoxicity[12]),hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis dysfunction,[13]and circadian-rhythm abnormalities.[14]Additionally, observational studies have linked depressive symptoms to nutrient deficiencies[15]andseasonal decreases in sunlight exposure. Unfortunately, in either case, it is difficult to assess whether these links are causal because other variables might be at play. For instance, less sunlight is associated withless exercise, and both are associated with worse sleep.[16]In turn, less exercise[17]and worse sleep are associated with lower mood.[18][19][20]"

These lesions are, dry and often itchy, swollen, oozing, crusting, and lichenified (thick and leathery). Scratching is common, which leads to a vicious cycle of irritation leading to scratching leading to further irritation. Psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia are also common.How is eczema diagnosed?Diagnosis is generally based on signs/symptoms and medical history. Eczema is chronic, so it can take a while to be sure that the lesions are due to eczema rather than a more acute phenomenon like an infection, rare allergy, or exposure to toxicants. A history or family history of asthma, hay fever, and dry skin also makes eczema more likely. To determine the severity of atopic dermatitis and track treatment progress, researchers and doctors objectively measure several characteristics of the lesions with scoring systems such as EASI and SCORAD.What are some of the main medical treatments for eczema?Pharmaceutical drugs for eczema are mostly immunosuppressive (focused on curtailing the excessive immune system activation). Some such drugs and drug types include monoclonal antibodies, JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and cromoglycate. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are also sometimes used to induce vasodilation. Lotion and other skincare products to reduce dryness and itchiness are also common.Have any supplements been studied for eczema?Several supplements have and continue to be investigated for eczema, though at present, the only ones approaching credibility from clinical trials are vitamin D and probiotics. They are also mechanistically plausible. Vitamin D is known to help regulate the immune system and plays a role in the formation of filaggrin, which helps to maintain the skin's moisture barrier. Some probiotics play a significant role in regulating the immune system to reduce excessive inflammation, maintain the gut barrier and prevent further inflammation."

Sex hormones are involved in nitric oxide synthesis, and men with lowtestosteroneare more likely to have ED. Anything that leads to dysfunction in the walls of the blood vessels, such as smoking, inactivity, and excessive body fat, can increase ED risk as well.Sometimes ED isn’t a breakdown in vasodilation or a hormonal problem but secondary to psychological issues ofanxietyand anhedonia — a diminished ability to feel pleasure.

While physical and mental fatigue are often found together, they're distinct as well. This page contains information on both. It's also helpful to distinguish between acute and chronic fatigue. Acute fatigue is normal and derives from doing tiring activities such as exercising, staying up later than usual, or doing mentally demanding work. Chronic fatigue is when, regardless of your activities, you're generally fatigued and lacking motivation. This isn't normal and suggests that something is wrong. The causes of chronic fatigue are numerous and include insomnia/poorsleep quality,stress,anxiety,depression, metabolic abnormalities, severe nutrient deficiencies, use of drugs, and a lack of exercise, among many others.Supplements on this page may work through ameliorating the various sleep and mood issues that can lead to fatigue, by being neuroprotective (as much fatigue is due to neural dysfunction) affecting metabolism, hormones, and neurological function, among other roles.

The immune system does this by fighting offpathogens, which can range from molecules to parasites. In order to do this, there are two main levels to immunity.The first level is called the theinnate immune system. This provides a quick first line of defense, and acts against a wide range of pathogens. The innate immune system is comprised in part by physical barriers such as the skin, nonspecific chemical defenses such as lysozyme (an enzyme secreted in various secretions such as tears and saliva that breaks down bacterial cell walls), and the normal flora, which are nonpathogenic bacteria that compete for space and resources with pathogenic bacteria. If a pathogen circumvents these defenses, it will then face theinflammatory responsewhich can attract immune cells to the site of infection and dilate blood vessels to help ferry them there.Interferonscan also be released which help fight viruses and tumors, and thecomplement systemcan attack the cell membranes of pathogens either disrupting them or promoting their elimination by other components of the immune system. Finally, various cells of the innate immune system can be activated.Phagocytic cellscan engulf invading pathogens and destroy them upon ingestion, whilenatural killer cellscan kill cells infected with a virus and tumor cells, andeosinophilscan produce and release substances that are effective against parasites.The second main level of immunty is called theadaptive immune system. This level takes time before responding to a pathogenic invasion, but once mobilized, it evokes a response specific to a particular pathogen, as opposed to the innate immune system, whose response is nonspecific. The adaptive immune system is also capable of remembering a specific pathogen, so that it can mount a more rapid, effective response to a pathogen which it has encounterd before. This is the basis of how vaccines work. The adaptive immune system is comprised of two main cell types:T cells(named because they were found in the thymus, the organ which they mature) andB cells(named for the bone marrow, where they are initially produced). Both kinds of cells are antigen-specific and are activated when they recognize an antigen of a pathogen. The two major types of T cells arekiller or cytotoxic T cellsandhelper T cells. The former kill cells that are infected with viruses or cancer cells. They are also called CD8+cells, since they have a co-receptor on their surface called CD8 that helps them recognize specific antigens. The latter help mount an immune response to a specific antigen in a multitude of ways, including the release ofcytokineswhich help regulate parts of the immune system, and can mature into memory cells (which help remember a specific antigen) and regulatory cells (sometimes called Tregs for short, which help downregulate the immune response). Helper T cells are also called CD4+due the the CD4 co-receptor on their surface. B cells make antigen-specificantibodieswhich can attach to pathogens and activate the compliment system more specifically, help phagocytes engulf the pathogen, or neutralize the pathogen by coating it."
c1558931-9915-434d-baee-75da52594e30,https://examine.com/outcomes/inflammation/,Inflammation,Summary,"What is inflammation?Inflammation is a danger or alarm signal triggered by infection or injury that mobilizes the immune system to help fight off invading pathogens or initiate the repair of damaged or injured tissue. It was originally defined by observations of what occurs during the process, as described by the following Latin words:Calor (heat) 
 Dolor (pain) 
 Rubor (redness) 
 Tumor (swelling)The pain, redness and swelling that occur with inflammation isn’t caused by the actual infection or injury, but the immune system’s reaction to them. When an inflammatory response is triggered, chemical messengers are released into the blood. This triggers an increase in the size of small blood vessels called capillaries, moving more blood into the damaged or infected region. Gaps also form in between the endothelial cells lining blood vessels, allowing blood plasma to leak into the surrounding tissues.The local increase in blood flow and leakage of plasma into the damaged area in-turn causes skin in the area to feel warm to the touch and take on a darker, more reddish color. Increased volume of fluid in the damaged area causes swelling, which in turn causes pain by increasing the pressure on local nerve endings. Release of chemical messengers called cytokines also makes the surface of the endothelial cells lining blood vessels more “sticky”, allowing white blood cells to attach to the blood vessel wall.After attaching to the blood vessel wall, white blood cells such as macrophages and neutrophils undergo a process called extravasation, where they squeeze in between the gaps in endothelial cells to move from the blood into the injured or damaged tissue. Macrophages and neutrophils in particular function as sort of first-responders, trafficking from the blood into the damaged or infected tissue to promote tissue repair or attack invading pathogens.As the macrophages and neutrophils are waging war with the invading pathogen or helping to clear out damaged tissue, more chemical substances are released that can further enhance inflammation leading to collateral tissue damage and more pain and swelling.What is chronic inflammation?The inflammatory response is designed to be acute and self-limiting. As microbes are eliminated and tissue integrity is restored, local immune cells secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines that promote tissue regeneration and resolution of the inflammation.Unlike acute inflammation, which may last days to weeks but eventually resolves, chronic inflammation is more of a slow, long-term type of inflammation that can last for months to years. While typically not as intense as acute inflammatory processes, chronic, low-grade inflammation does not tend to resolve and also is a contributing factor to the pathology of many diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, cardiovascular disease, arthritis and joint diseases, and metabolic disorders.Chronic inflammation can have many causes, including failure of the immune system to clear a pathogen or toxic substance from the body, or metabolic dysfunction that leads to an increase in toxic byproducts such as reactive oxygen species.Unlike acute inflammation, which is more intense but self-limiting and short-lived, chronic inflammation can last for months or years, and is a contributing factor to many chronic diseases."

d2e97d85-e759-4e21-bccf-395602872be0,https://examine.com/outcomes/insulin/,Insulin,Summary,"Insulin is a hormone in the body secreted from the Pancreas, and is known as the Master regulator of carbohydrate metabolism. It works in concert with its sister hormone, Glucagon, and a host of other hormones to regulate blood sugar levels in the body and protect from an excess of blood sugar (hyperglycemia) or too low a level of blood sugar (hypoglycemia).It is mostly an anabolic hormone, meaning it acts to build molecules and tissues. It has some catabolic properties though (catabolic as in acting to destroy molecules and tissues to provide energy).When active, insulin and the actions of the proteins under its control can be summed up with having two main actions:Causing a flux of nutrients into the liver, fat, and muscle; to get said nutrients out of the bloodCausing a metabolic shift towards carbohydrates, favoring them as fuel, and thus minimizing usage of both fats and proteins for energyIt is increased in response to the diet. Most notably carbohydrates and to a lesser extent proteins. In contrast to many hormones, insulin is one that is highly responsive to diet and lifestyle; manipulating insulin levels through one's diet and lifestyle is common in diet strategies.It is essential to survival, and those who do not produce any or insufficient levels of insulin must inject it otherwise (Type I Diabetics).Insulin has a phenomena known as 'Insulin Sensitivity' which can be summed up as 'The amount of action a single molecule of insulin can exert inside a cell'. The more insulin sensitivity you have, the less overall insulin you need to exert the same effect. A large scale and prolonged state of insulin _in_sensitivity is what is known as Type II diabetes (among other co-morbidities).Insulin is neither bad nor good from a health and body composition perspective. It has certain roles in the body and activating it may or may not be beneficial for particular individuals, but may also be wondrous for others. Typically sedentary obese persons would be wise to limit insulin secretion while power athletes or relatively lean athletic individuals would be wise to use carbohydrate timing strategies to maximize the effects of insulin."

Insulin resistance is thought to have an inflammatory component[3].There are lots of ways[4]to measure insulin resistance. The gold standard is the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. In this technique, insulin is infused into a vein to reach a constant level in the blood. Since insulin is being pumped into the blood, the person has artificially high insulin, or hyperinsulinemia. Simultaneously, glucose is also infused at a varying rate until the blood glucose level stabilizes at a normal level. When a person’s blood glucose is normal, this is called eugylcemia (the Greek root “eu-” means “good”). At this point, the rate of glucose infusion exactly equals the amount being taken up by the body’s tissues, which is a direct measure of insulin sensitivity. The more glucose that has to be infused to keep euglycemic, the more’s being taken up, meaning the tissue is more sensitive to insulin.The problem with this technique is it takes a couple of hours and is relatively expensive. Thus, estimates of insulin resistance that are cheaper and easier to measured have been developed. Two major ones are HOMA-IR and QUICKI. Both just require a single blood draw where fasting glucose and C-peptide (a byproduct of insulin synthesis) are measured. These values are then plugged into an equation that estimates insulin sensitivity. However, these estimations aren’t perfect."

It is associated with abdominal pain, bloating, excessive flatulence, and altered bowel habits, severely lowering a person’s quality of life. Functional gastrointestinal disorders like IBS are not caused by structural abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors. Rather, they occur as a result of an abnormally functioning GI tract. This makes it difficult to accurately diagnose a person because no biomarker can indicate whether or not someone is suffering from IBS. Thus, clinicians have to rely on the reports of patients and on a set of criteria that have evolved over time for diagnosis.Although the cause of IBS is still not well understood, researchers have put forth several hypotheses. Some of these theories include infections of the GI tract[2], psychological stress[3], abnormalities in gut motility[4], and gut-brain axis problems.[5]Unfortunately, no cures currently exist for IBS. It is usually managed through a combination of lifestyle changes (e.g., avoiding triggering foods, staying well hydrated), with prescription drugs being used if warranted.IBS can be characterized according to its predominant symptoms: diarrhea (IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C), both (IBS-M, where the ‘M’ stands for ‘mixed’), or undetermined (IBS-U) as shown in Figure 1."

When a persistent lack of sexual fantasies and desire leads to notable distress and difficulties in relationships, that's when it's deemed Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). It affects both men and women and is fairly common.Low libido is a combination of physiological, psychological, and social factors, and varies in its cause from person to person. Fatigue, depression, and stress/anxiety are commonly cited reasons for low libido. Dysfunctional signaling in the dopaminergic reward system of the brain, or an excess of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin, prolactin, opioids, and endocannabinoids, particularly from drug abuse, is a reason for low libido. On the social end of things, strained relationships may be a common cause, and in that case, supplements will be unlikely to help."

The pursuit for longevity tends to look for both chronological enhancement (life extension) and either preserving or enhancing function during this chronological enhancement (vitality) and attempts to capitalize on both 'adding years to life' as well as 'adding life to years'.Longevity research begins with experimentation on yeast, nematodes (C. Elegans), and fruit flies (drosophilia) due to their short life cycles. Fluctuations in the human lifespan would take an impractical 90 years to test;C. Elegans'90-day lifespan serves as a convenient alternative for initial longevity trials. Once mechanisms are established in these shorter research models, studies are conducted in mammalian species such as mice and rats. Human studies are nonexistent for practical reasons.Additionally, caloric restriction (40-50% of standard caloric intake) appears to reliably produce life extension in all tested non-human subjects and case studies (anecdotes) of humans on caloric restriction suggest it delays the aging phenotype; due to the high possibility that caloric restriction is able to enhance lifespan, many mechanisms and phenomena are considered to be 'caloric restriction related' or 'caloric restriction independent'.The following summary covers molecular pathways and targets of interest, which are useful as they are the druggable targets that one would consider when supplementing to promote longevity. 'Phenomena of interest' refer to the actual aging process, and attempts to tie these phenomena into the druggable targets."

More precisely, they carry cholesterol from the liver to other parts of the body, via the bloodstream.The greater the number ofLDL particles(LDL-P) in the blood, the more likely some will pass into artery walls, become oxidized, and kickstart plaque formation,[1]leading to atherosclerosis. Therefore, to predictcardiovascular disease(CVD), LDL-P matters more thanLDL cholesterol(LDL-C),[2][3]which is simply a measure of the amount of the cholesterol carried by LDL particles.If two people have the same LDL-C but one has cholesterol-rich LDL (large, “fluffy” particles) and the other cholesterol-poor LDL (smaller, denser particles), the second will have a greater LDL-P (more LDL particles total) and be at greater risk of heart disease.While a WHO meta-analysis ofsaturated fatdidn’t cover LDL-P,[4]it did report the levels ofapolipoprotein B(apoB), the protein component of LDL. Since each LDL particle has one molecule of apoB, apoB concentrations provide a good estimate of LDL-P concentrations and are a strong predictor of heart disease risk.[5][6]To predict heart disease, LDL-P (the number of LDL particles) matters more than LDL-C (the amount of cholesterol those particles carry). There is one molecule ofapolipoprotein B(apoB) in each LDL particle, so apoB is a good estimate of LDL-P."

It's so integral to the ability to learn skills, form and develop relationships, and make decisions that it garners a considerable amount of attention in science and from consumers of health products. Perhaps the most critical memory-related issue today is neurodegeneration. As the average lifespan of people has increased, it has become more common to develop neurodegenerative diseases, the most common being Alzheimer's, which negatively impacts memory, among other mental faculties. There are many hypotheses as to its causes, and it remains controversial, but it's clear that damaged and dysfunctional brain cells due to aging are at play.Even without a full-blown disease, a gradual decline of memory with age is typical, and a vast array of ""nootropics"" (substances intended to promote cognitive function) have become available to meet the demand for better memory. Even young people, with no apparent decline in memory, seek to enhance their minds through supplementation. This page deals with three instances: in diseases, normal cognitive decline due to aging, and those with normal memory.Memory is naturally tied to many of the other psychological and physiological phenomena.Anxiety,stress,depression, fatigue, andsleep qualityall have an effect on memory. Mitochondrial and metabolic health are also at play because sluggish energy transport and metabolism will likely reduce the brain's processing speed. For that reason, it's essential to be clear about the study population, because the effects of many supplements may only be relevant to people with some health issues, and may not necessarily translate to others."

Perimenopause is the transitional phase into menopause and may last between 4 to 8 years. During this phase, menstrual periods become irregular due to fluctuating hormone levels.For this page, we use the generic term 'woman', but this information can apply to anyone with ovaries and/or who might be undergoing a hormonal shift associated with the symptoms of menopause."

Over time, a woman’s ovarian follicles and granulosa cells diminish. Given these cells are the main producers of estradiol and inhibin[1](a hormone that tells the pituitary gland to make less follicle stimulating hormone), the body’s hormonal balance shifts toward lower estrogen levels and increased follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels. This hormonal profile results in irregular menstrual cycles, which ultimately stop altogether. One clinical indicator that a woman is postmenopausal is a follicle-stimulating hormone level greater than 30 mIU/mL and an estradiol level under 30 pg/m.[2]Hormonal variations across a woman's lifetimePrimary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a condition often characterized by entering menopause at a young age (i.e. prior to 40 years). There are a variety of causes that underlie POI, but the main one is estrogen deficiency.[3]Other factors that play a role in POI are genetic disorders, autoimmune disease, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and metabolic disorders. Smoking has also been associated with early menopause.[4]"

Women can also experience changes in body composition. The majority of these symptoms are a result of hormonal fluctuations accompanying the decline to infertility, with hot flashes among the most commonly reported.In fact, as many as half of all women report experiencing hot flashes even before they cease menstruating. Hot flashes peak during the later phases of the menopausal transition, tapering off in late menopause. Women tend to experience these symptoms for roughly five years.[5][6]Changes in vaginal tissue resulting from decreased estrogen account for a number of other commonly reported symptoms, including an increase in urinary tract infections, vaginal atrophy, burning, urinary incontinence, and discomfort during intercourse.[7]Moreover, these changes in hormone levels after menopause affect metabolic processes that can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and stroke.[8]Regarding changes in body composition, the transition into menopause marks a time when women are particularly prone to gaining fat and losing lean mass. Later onset of menopause seems to temper this increase in weight and body fat.[9]Hormonal changes also tend to shift body fat distribution from a gynoid pattern (body fat around the hips and buttocks) to a more android pattern (body fat around the midsection).[10]"

3fb8d2e3-87ea-42f9-9699-8f5996a90e87,https://examine.com/outcomes/multiple-sclerosis-risk/,Multiple Sclerosis Risk,Summary,"The immune system is heavily involved in the pathophysiology (changes brought on by disease) of MS, but it’s not clear what provokes this response in the first place. Viral infections, genetics, and environmental factors have all been connected to MS in observational research. Extreme grief may also predispose people to the disease.[1][2][3][4]AutoimmunityThe high degree of immune involvement in MS and the fact that women are more prone to autoimmune diseases (and to MS) than men strongly suggests that MS is an autoimmune condition. This hasn’t been directly proven though; ideally, researchers would be able to identify a single self-antigen or autoreactive T cell that could cause disease in otherwise healthy lab animals.[5]Although this has been possible with certain autoimmune diseases, such as myasthenia gravis and lupus, it is averyhigh standard, and it may be a long time before this can be done for MS.[6]Viral infectionsIt’s possible that a viral infection sets MS into motion.[2]People who have Epstein-Barr virus antibodies in their blood (which suggests being previously infected with the virus) have about 4.5 times greater odds of developing MS than those who have not had the virus. Similarly, people with a history of infectious mononucleosis (typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus) have about 2 times greater odds of developing MS than people who haven’t had mono.[4]It’s worth noting, however, that about 90% of the world’s population tests positive for Epstein-Barr by age 35.[7]If a risk factor is common, it’s easy to correlate it with many things (e.g., “drinking water” could be a risk factor for many diseases, because everyone with a given disease is likely to have drunk water).GeneticsThere aren’t any single alleles (gene variations) known to cause MS. That being said, certain alleles in the genes that encode forhuman leukocyte antigens(HLAs) in themajor histocompatibility complex(MHC, part of the genome that encodes for a variety of cell surface proteins that are used by the immune system to identify “self”) are associated with a considerable increase in risk of MS.[8]Additionally, a number of genes outside the MHC are associated with small increases or decreases in risk.
Individuals who have a first-degree family member with MS have an increased risk of developing the condition compared with people who have no immediate family history of MS. In a study conducted in Denmark, for example, first-degree relatives of someone with MS had about a 7 times increased risk of developing it over their lifetime.[9]Interestingly, spouses did not have any increased risk; the authors suggest that this rules out environmental factors, but it’s probably more correct to say that without certain genetic factors present, environmental factors aren’t likely to have a strong effect on whether the disease manifests.SexWomen have an increased risk of developing MS compared with men, a relative risk that has been increasing. Currently, women are at about 3 times the risk of developing MS as men.[10][11]It’s not clear why this is, but some speculations include:Women are having children less often and later in life; previous pregnancy and number of children have both been associated with a lower risk of MS in observational research.[12]Women have much stronger T helper 1 (Th1) immune responses than men. Given that MS is characterized by a high level of Th1 activation, it’s possible that women’s predisposition for MS is due to a sex-specific difference in immune system activity.[13]Behavior/EnvironmentVitamin DThere is some observational evidence that vitamin D protects against the development and progression of MS, as well as MS-related disability[14][15]. High serum levels of vitamin D are associated with a lower risk of MS, and both supplemental vitamin D and sun exposure (which increases vitamin D) show the same trend. Furthermore, a Mendelian randomization trial found that, as the number of alleles associated with low vitamin D in four genes increases, so does the risk of MS.[16]Many of the studies that evaluate vitamin D have a high risk of bias, however, and shouldn’t be considered strong evidence of this relationship.[4]An important caveat to these findings is that a large amount of this research has been conducted in predominantly white countries, such as Australia and the Scandinavian countries. A study in the U.S. found that, among non-Hispanic white people, higher serum levels of vitamin D were associated with a lower risk of developing MS, but this relationship wasn’t present in the Black or Hispanic study participants.[17]Given that the degree of skin pigmentation is associated with lower levels of vitamin D, this weakens the evidence that vitamin D is somehow a cause of MS in all people. Additionally, supplementing with vitamin D in people with MS hasn’t seemed to improve the condition in clinical trials.[18]ObesityIndividuals who are obese in early life ( childhood to young adulthood) have about double the risk of developing MS as individuals who are not obese during this time period.[14][19]SmokingThere is strong observational evidence that smoking increases the risk of MS by 20–60%, depending on the amount someone smokes. It’s possible that this increase in risk is related to the vascular or immune effects of smoking, and/or the general toxicity of compounds found in cigarette smoke.[15][4]Geographic LocationThe prevalence of MS varies considerably across countries: regions in North America and Europe can have a prevalence of over 100 cases per 100,000 people, while regions in East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have approximately 2 per 100,000 people.[20]"

While there are different theories on what exactly produces fatigue in a muscle,[3][4]muscular endurance at least partially relies on the muscle’s ability to remove waste products[5]and prevent a buildup of acidity in the muscle.[6]Other models of fatigue that involve biomechanics, muscle recruitment, cellular mechanisms, and the brain have also been proposed.[3][4]"

cccdc6bd-3131-478d-b0ac-62f4c527f562,https://examine.com/outcomes/muscular-endurance/,Muscular Endurance,What types of training can improve muscular endurance?,"The type of training that best develops muscular endurance depends on the type of exercise. Generally, exercises can be classed asdynamicorstatic. Dynamic exercises can be divided intoisotonicmovements andisokineticmovements. Isotonic movements are where the joints and muscles move through their range of motion under a constant resistance, while isokinetic exercise requires a machine to keep the body moving at a constant speed regardless of the resistance applied. Static exercise is frequently described asisometric, meaning that the body holds the same position against a fixed resistance to perform exercises such as planks or wall sits.[8][6]For dynamic exercises, muscular endurance is best developed by high repetitions at submaximal resistance: for example, high reps of a squat at 50% of a1-repetition maximum(1RM) load. For static exercises, time-based training is the best way to develop endurance: for example, long-duration wall sits.Dynamic exercise is commonly recommended due to its similarity to everyday activities, and isotonic dynamic exercise, such as weightlifting, is the most practical option for the average person. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends isotonic resistance training at a low-to-moderate intensity, or at less than 50% of a 1RM weight, for two sets of 15–25 repetitions performed 2–3 times per week to improve muscular endurance.[9]"

Effects may be more consistent when consumed 60 minutes prior to exercise.[11]Though individual variation is high for caffeine side effects and tolerance, doses of 3–6 mg/kg of body mass are typically recommended for improving muscular endurance.[7]Creatinemonohydrate increases muscular endurance by increasing stores of creatine phosphate, which rapidly produces energy in the form ofadenosine triphosphate(ATP) when it is burned. Faster ATP replenishment means an athlete is able to accomplish more repetitions or exert more effort.[12][13]As a normal diet contains 1–2 g per day of creatine, it typically takes 5 g per day for 5–7 days to saturate muscle creatine stores. A maintenance dose is typically 3–5 g per day.[12]Additionally,beta-alaninecan benefit muscular endurance during bouts of exercise lasting 1–10 minutes. Four weeks of 4–6 grams per day of beta-alanine can increase musclecarnosineconcentrations, thereby helping to balance acidity in the cell, and may also attenuate neuromuscular fatigue. It should be known before consuming that beta-alanine may produce a strong tingling sensation on the skin that is harmless.[14][15]Other supplements with some promise but less overall consistency for improving muscle endurance includenitrates,sodium bicarbonate, andcitrulline.[16][17][18]"

Higher protein intakes (2.3–3.1 g/kg of fat-free mass per day) may help to retain muscle mass in those pursuing fat loss.

To account for this, charts have been developed based on age and sex to see how far away from average any given girl or boy is at a certain age.[1][2]These can be expressed as either percentiles or z-scores. A z-score is a standardized way to state how far away from the mean a measurement is. If the z-score is 0, it means that the value in question is identical to the mean value for the group. A positive or negative z-score reveals how many standard deviations away from the mean a measurement is, with positive values meaning that the measurement in question is above the mean, while negative values would be below it.Just like with adults, “overweight” and “obese” can be defined using age-based BMIs for children. Overweight for a child is defined as a BMI-for-age equal to or greater than the 85th percentile and less than the 95th percentile. Obesity for a child is defined as a BMI-for-age equal to or greater than the 95th percentile.[3]And just like with adults, these age-based BMIs for children can serve as a proxy for amount of body fat, albeit a far from perfect one.[4]"

VO2is measured in liters of oxygen per minute (L/min) and therefore represents therateat which oxygen is being consumed by metabolically active tissues (e.g., muscle).Oxygen uptake can be used to calculate total body energy expenditure using a method known as indirect calorimetry. Though VO2can be measured at rest, it’s more commonly measured during exercise.When oxygen uptake is measured during an exercise test performed to exhaustion, we can determine someone’sVO2max— the maximal rate at which the body can consume oxygen during exercise.VO2max is seen as the single best indicator of cardiorespiratory or aerobic fitness because as you become fitter, your body becomes better at using oxygen to produce energy and your VO2max increases. However, a higher VO2max doesn’t always translate to improved exercise or sports performance because some activities involve moments when energy requirements are so great (the intensity is so high) that oxygen isn’t used to generate the required energy. This is known as anaerobic (“without oxygen”) exercise.Elite endurance athletes often have a very high VO2max, but this is just one aspect that determines aerobic exercise performance. Furthermore, oxygen uptake is also recognized as an important factor in healthspan and longevity, and having a higher VO2max is associated with reduced all-cause mortality.[1]"

Notice that each part of the wave is labeled with the letters P, Q, R, S, and T. This clarifies what a QT interval is: it’s the distance between Q and T, and represents[1]the electrical depolarization and repolarization of the heart’s ventricles that makes for a heartbeat. These electrical currents are caused by ion channels opening and closing, letting charged ions into and out of heart cells. If these channels malfunction, this process can take longer than normal, which makes the QT interval longer. The thing is, everyone’s QT interval varies a little, so the QT is often corrected in a few ways, the most simple of which is the Bazett method, which divides the QT interval by the square root of the RR distance (also shown in Figure 1), which is a measure of heart rate. A QTc interval corrected with the Bazett method is considered prolonged[2]if it is greater than 450 milliseconds for men and 470 milliseconds for women.Figure 1: The ABCs of QTcA prolonged QTc interval is bad news, as it can lead to a serious heartbeat problem known as “Torsade de Pointes,” which is French for “turning of the points,” because the peaks in the ECG looks like they’re twisting around.

The sensations, which are commonly reported[2]as electrical, prickling, burning, tingling, and itching, typically worsen at night, when individuals are more likely to rest. This can be incredibly disruptive to sleep quality, which is why RLS is also classified as a sleep disorder[3].The condition is estimated to affect 10% of the U.S. population and, as you can see in Figure 1, is more prevalent in women[4]than in men. It’s also more prevalent in individuals of western European descent[5]than those of Asian descent. Researchers believe that there is a strong genetic[6]basis to RLS, since individuals with a family history of RLS are also very likely to have the disorder. Genome-wide association studies[7]have identified variants in six different genes linked to RLS. While much remains unknown, some of these genes have been linked to the development of neurons[8].Despite this, much evidence[9][10]suggests that dysfunctions in the basal ganglia and in dopamine-producing neurons play roles in the pathology of RLS. These areas are responsible for controlling smooth muscle, which is involved in controlling involuntary movements like those in the digestive tract. Dysfunctions in the brain regions that control these muscles can lead to disruptive involuntary movements. More evidence to support the role of dopamine dysfunction in RLS comes from individuals with Parkinson’s disease, a degenerative condition in which dopamine-producing cells in the brain die at a rapid rate. These individuals are also more likely[11]to develop RLS.In the past, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine has recommended[12]dopamine agonists (drugs that activate specific dopamine receptors) as evidence-based treatments for RLS in its clinical practice guidelines. A 2011 Cochrane systematic review[13]and meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials found that dopamine-agonists were effective in reducing symptoms of restlessness in individuals with RLS, when compared to placebo. However, participants taking dopamine agonists also had an 82% higher chance of experiencing adverse events, which may make such treatments undesirable for some. Adverse effects such as worsening symptoms over the long term (called “augmentation”) and an increase in impulse control problems led the Restless Leg Syndrome Foundation to downgrade dopamine agonists to a second-line choice for therapy in 2021.[14]"

e67e4318-7d12-48d9-975c-772d0a3cd399,https://examine.com/outcomes/tinnitus-symptoms/,Tinnitus Symptoms,Summary,"Tinnitus[1]is defined as a condition during which a person hears sound that isn’t caused by an external source. The sound most people with tinnitus describe is a steady, high-pitched ringing, but the sound has also been described as continuous or intermittent whistling, static, whooshing, musical noise, or buzzing. Approximately 1 in 10 adults[2]in the U.S. experienced at least one bout of tinnitus over the course of a year, with just over a third of those reporting chronic problems. If tinnitus is persistent and intolerable or extremely bothersome, it can cause functional impairment[3]in thought processing, emotional state, hearing, sleep, and concentration.There are two general types of tinnitus. Objective tinnitus (about 5% of cases) refers to sounds that are able to be heard with external instruments, such as a stethoscope. This type of tinnitus is usually caused by damage to the bones or vasculature of the ear. Subjective tinnitus (about 95% of cases) refers to sounds that cannot be heard from the outside and is thought to be caused by damage to the neuronal system of the ear. Figure 1 provides more detail about the differences between these types."
7d42c78a-7272-4391-abe7-b0c9686b92b0,https://examine.com/outcomes/tmao/,TMAO,Summary,"TrimethylamineN-oxide(TMAO) is a compound generated by gut microbial metabolism that has been implicated in increased disease risk. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses[1][2](whose results are shown in Figure 1) determined that TMAO is associated with a significantly higher risk of both all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. One possible mechanism for TMAO's effects may be disruption of cholesterol transport by increasing forward transport and decreasing reverse cholesterol transport[3]. However, whether these associations are actually causal is open to question.[4][5]TMAO has been shown to be generated from substrates with a trimethylamine (TMA) moiety such as L-carnitine and choline[3]. L-carnitine is found in a variety of both plant and animal sources. However, levels of free L-carnitine are highest in meat products[6]and very low in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. L-carnitine is also added into some popular energy drinks[7]with the expectation that it increases performance and helps to burn fat, although the evidence for those expectations is not clear. While vegetarians and vegans have considerably lower dietary intake of carnitine, studies show that their circulating levels in the blood are not drastically lower than people who consume meat and remain generally within the normal range[8]. This is because carnitine can be synthesized in the liver, kidney, and brain[9]if not enough is consumed in the diet.Several studies[10]have now demonstrated that dietary L-carnitine can be converted in the gut to TMA, at which point TMA can then be converted to TMAO in the liver by the enzyme flavin monooxygenase. However, researchers in 2013 discovered that a compound called γ-butyrobetaine (γ-BB) was formed[11]as an intermediate between L-carnitine and TMA formation in mice."
ab160a7b-3284-430e-adc4-66b8a4084be1,https://examine.com/outcomes/tnf-alpha/,TNF-Alpha,Summary,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) got its name from its ability to kill off tumor cells in mice. It’s a protein that’s released from a wide range of cells in order to activate the immune system.It accomplishes this in a variety of ways, including (but not limited to) inducing fever, helping initiate the “acute phase response,” which increases inflammation in response to injury and can help fight off microbes and clean up, as well as attracting white blood cells to sites of injury and infection. Since it “moves cells” to do its job and because it promotes inflammation, it is known as a “proinflammatory cytokine.” In short, TNF-alpha boosts the immune system.While “boosting the immune system” may sound like a good thing, the immune system is pretty powerful and can cause a lot of collateral damage in the body if boosted too much. For instance, some of the effects[1]of malaria infection are not due to the parasite itself, but because of overproduction of TNF-alpha. It may also cause some trouble in other major diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease[2], Alzheimer’s[3], and depression[4]. Lower levels may be associated with longevity as well, but the research on this has been conflicting[5]."

Conversely,low-density lipoproteins(LDL) carry cholesterol from your liver to other parts of your body, via your blood. While higher levels ofHDL cholesterol(HDL-C) tend to decrease the risk ofcardiovascular disease(CVD), higher levels ofLDL cholesterol(LDL-C) tend to increase it; for that reason, HDL-C is often called the “good cholesterol” and LDL-C the “bad cholesterol” — yet both are needed to keep you alive."

It is typically determined based on the smallest letter that can be read on a chart and is often expressed in terms of letters visible at 20 feet (e.g., having 20/30 vision means being able to read at 20 feet the letters that a person with “normal” vision can read at 30 feet).[1]"
cbfc9a66-9d82-4031-a967-b0c6bca4a7c4,https://examine.com/outcomes/weight/,Weight,Summary,"Mass is a measure of how much matter is in an object. Unlike its weight, the mass of an object is constant. If an object’s mass is 1 gram on Earth, its mass is 1 gram on the Moon.An object’s weight is its relative mass. Unlike mass proper, weight is affected by gravity: it will be different on Earth and on the Moon; it can even vary on Earth (a given object is slightly heavier at sea level than at the top of a mountain, and at the equator than at the poles).For our purpose, however, mass and weight and pretty much interchangeable. The “weight” in “water weight” and the “mass” in “fat mass” are matters of convention. When “weight” is used alone, it refers to body weight."
